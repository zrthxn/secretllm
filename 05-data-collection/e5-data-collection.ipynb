      "Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.[3] He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B language.[3] Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1983, the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1990, and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999.\n",
      "Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.\n",
      "Early life and education[edit]\n",
      "Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime Bell Labs scientist and co-author of The Design of Switching Circuits[4] on switching circuit theory.[5] As a child, Dennis moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey, where he graduated from Summit High School.[6] He graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics and applied mathematics in 1963.[5]\n",
      "Career[edit]\n",
      "Ken Thompson (left) and Dennis Ritchie (right), in 1973\n",
      "Version 7 Unix for the PDP-11, including Dennis Ritchie's home directory: /usr/dmr\n",
      "In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center. In 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on \"Computational Complexity and Program Structure\" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard library, a requirement for the degree.[7][8] In 2020, the Computer History Museum worked with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found a copy of the lost dissertation.[8][9]\n",
      "During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, Brian Kernighan suggested the name \"Unix\", a pun on the name \"Multics\".[10] To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many years.[11]\n",
      "During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.[12] Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security Agency, the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle applied to machines still in use by foreign governments.[12]\n",
      "Ritchie was also involved with the development of the operating systems Plan 9 and Inferno, and the programming language Limbo.\n",
      "As part of an AT&T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.[13]\n",
      "C and Unix[edit]\n",
      "Usenix conference, 1984\n",
      "Ritchie conversing in a chalet in the mountains surrounding Salt Lake City\n",
      "Ritchie, standing in middle, in a striped sweater, behind Steven Bellovin in a baseball cap\n",
      "Ritchie created the C programming language and was one of the developers of the Unix operating system. With Brian Kernighan, he co-wrote the book The C Programming Language, which is often referred to as K&R after their initials. Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchie's contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.[14] They were so influential on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, \"The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed.\"[15]\n",
      "Nowadays, the C language is widely used in application, operating system, and embedded system development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. C is a low-level language with constructs closely translating to the hardware's instruction set. However, it is not tied to any given hardware, making it easy to write programs on any machine that supports C.[16] Moreover, C is a high-level programming language with constructs mapping to data structures in application software.\n",
      "C influenced several other languages and derivatives, such as C++, Objective-C used by Apple, C# used by Microsoft, and Java used in corporate environments extensively and by Android. Ritchie and Thompson used C to write Unix, which has been influential in establishing many computing concepts and principles that are adopted widely.\n",
      "In an interview from 1999, Ritchie clarified that he saw Linux and Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating systems as a continuation of the basis of the Unix operating system, and as derivatives of Unix:[17]\n",
      "I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful, because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided. Linux seems to be among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers.\n",
      "In the same interview, he stated that he viewed Unix and Linux as \"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago.\"[17]\n",
      "Awards[edit]\n",
      "In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award \"for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system\".[18] Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled \"Reflections on Software Research\".[19] In 1990, both Ritchie and Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), \"for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language\".[20]\n",
      "In 1997, both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, \"for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language.\"[21]\n",
      "On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, \"led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age\".[22][23]\n",
      "In 2005, the Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.[24]\n",
      "In 2011, Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.[25]\n",
      "Death[edit]\n",
      "Dennis Ritchie (right) with Doug McIlroy (left) in May 2011\n",
      "Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone.[3] First news of his death came from his former colleague, Rob Pike.[26][27][28] He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease.[3][26][29][30] News of Ritchie's death was largely overshadowed by the media coverage of the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, which occurred the week before.[31]\n",
      "Legacy[edit]\n",
      "Following Ritchie's death, computer historian Paul E. Ceruzzi stated:[32]\n",
      "Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside.\n",
      "In an interview shortly after Ritchie's death, long-time colleague Brian Kernighan said Ritchie never expected C to be so significant.[33] Kernighan told The New York Times \"The tools that Dennis built—and their direct descendants—run pretty much everything today.\"[34] Kernighan reminded readers of how important a role C and Unix had played in the development of later high-profile projects, such as the iPhone.[35][36] Other testimonials to his influence followed.[37][38][39][40]\n",
      "Reflecting upon his death, a commentator compared the relative importance of Steve Jobs and Ritchie, concluding that \"[Ritchie's] work played a key role in spawning the technological revolution of the last forty years—including technology on which Apple went on to build its fortune.\"[41] Another commentator said, \"Ritchie, on the other hand, invented and co-invented two key software technologies which make up the DNA of effectively every single computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the modern age. It sounds like a wild claim, but it really is true.\"[42] Another said, \"many in computer science and related fields knew of Ritchie's importance to the growth and development of, well, everything to do with computing,...\"[43]\n",
      "The Fedora 16 Linux distribution, which was released about a month after he died, was dedicated to his memory.[44] FreeBSD 9.0, released January 12, 2012, was also dedicated in his memory.[45]\n",
      "Asteroid 294727 Dennisritchie, discovered by astronomers Tom Glinos and David H. Levy in 2008, was named in his memory.[46] The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 7 February 2012 (Minor Planet Circulars (M.P.C.) 78272).[47]\n",

(1963) in Engineering Physics from the University of Toronto, then an M.A. (1965) and Ph.D. (1967) in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science from Princeton University.[6] He conducted research at Bell Labs from 1967 to 1991, and again from 1997 to 2002 as Vice President of the Computing Sciences Research Center.[7] Since 1995, he has held the Lawrence Gussman Professorship in Computer Science at Columbia University. He served as chair of the department from 1995 to 1997, and again in the spring of 2003.[8]\\nIn his PhD thesis Aho created indexed grammars[9] and the nested-stack automaton[10] as vehicles for extending the power of context-free languages, but retaining many of their decidability and closure properties. One application of indexed grammars is modelling parallel rewriting systems,[11] particularly in biological applications.[12]\\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Aho joined the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs where he devised efficient regular expression and string-pattern matching algorithms that he implemented in the first versions of the Unix tools egrep and fgrep. The fgrep algorithm has become known as the Aho–Corasick algorithm; it is used by several bibliographic search-systems, including the one developed by Margaret J. Corasick, and by other string-searching applications.[13]\\nAt Bell Labs, Aho worked closely with Steve Johnson and Jeffrey Ullman to develop efficient algorithms for analyzing and translating programming languages.[14] Steve Johnson used the bottom-up LALR parsing algorithms to create the syntax-analyzer generator yacc,[15] and Michael E. Lesk and Eric Schmidt used Aho\\'s regular-expression pattern-matching algorithms to create the lexical-analyzer generator lex.[16] The lex and yacc tools and their derivatives have been used to develop the front ends of many of today\\'s programming language compilers.[17]\\nAho and Ullman wrote a series of textbooks on compiling techniques that codified the theory relevant to compiler design. Their 1977 textbook Principles of Compiler Design had a green dragon on the front cover and became known as \"the green dragon book\". In 1986 Aho and Ullman were joined by Ravi Sethi to create a new edition, \"the red dragon book\" (which was briefly shown in the 1995 movie Hackers), and in 2006 also by Monica Lam to create \"the purple dragon book\". The dragon books are used for university courses as well as industry references.[18]\\nIn 1974, Aho, John Hopcroft, and Ullman wrote The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms,[19] codifying some of their early research on algorithms. This book became one of the most highly cited books in computer science for several decades and helped to stimulate the creation of algorithms and data structures as a central course in the computer science curriculum.[20]\\nAho is also widely known for his co-authorship of the AWK programming language with Peter J. Weinberger and Brian Kernighan (the \"A\" stands for \"Aho\").[21] As of 2010 Aho\\'s research interests include programming languages, compilers, algorithms, and quantum computing. He is part of the Language and Compilers research-group at Columbia University.[22]\\nOverall, his works have been cited 81,040 times and he has an h-index of 66, as of May 8, 2019.[23]\\nAho has received many prestigious honors, including the IEEE\\'s John von Neumann Medal and membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003.[24] He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Waterloo,[25] from the University of Helsinki,[25] and from the University of Toronto.[26] He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ACM, Bell Labs, and IEEE.[20]\\nAho has twice served as chair of the Advisory Committee for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation. He is a past president of the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computability Theory.[27] Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman were co-recipients of the 2017 C&C Prize awarded by NEC Corporation.[28] He and Ullman were named recipients of the 2020 Turing Award on March 31, 2021.[5]\\nTeaching[edit]\\nAho has taught at Columbia University in New York City since 1995. He won the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates in 2003.[29][30]\\nBooks[edit]\\nA. V. Aho and J. D. Ullman, The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling, Vol. 1, Parsing.

Her father was a farmer, and her mother an elementary schoolteacher.[9] Her early elementary education took place in a one-room school house a mile away from her home, and she later attended a local high school.[10]\\nShe graduated from The New York State College for Teachers (now part of the University at Albany, SUNY) with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1954 and began teaching school in Peru, New York.[10] After two years, she enrolled at the University of Michigan and earned a Master of Science degree in mathematics in 1957.[11]\\nCareer and research[edit]\\nDeeply in debt with student loans, she joined IBM Research in Poughkeepsie, New York, as a programmer in 1957, where she taught incoming employees the basics of Fortran. She planned to return to teaching once her student loans had been paid, but ended up staying with IBM for her entire 45-year career. In 1959, Allen was assigned to the Harvest project for code breaking with the National Security Agency, and worked on a programming language called Alpha.[7] She managed the compiler-optimization team for both Harvest and the Stretch project.\\nIn 1962, she was transferred to Thomas J. Watson Research Center, where she contributed to the ACS-1 project, and later in the 1970s, to PL/I. During these years, she worked with fellow researcher John Cocke to write a series of seminal papers on optimizing compilers, helping to improve the efficiency of machine code translated from high-level languages.[2]\\nFrom 1970 to 1971 she spent a sabbatical at New York University and acted as adjunct professor for a few years afterward. Another sabbatical brought her to Stanford University in 1977.[11]\\nFrom 1980 to 1995, Allen led IBM\\'s work in the developing parallel computing area, and helped to develop software for the IBM Blue Gene project.[12] Allen became the first female IBM Fellow in 1989. She retired from IBM in 2002, but remained affiliated with the corporation as a Fellow Emerita. In 2007, the IBM Ph.D. Fellowship Award was created in her honor.[13] After retiring, she remained active in programs that encourage women and girls to seek careers in science and computing.[14]\\nHer A. M. Turing Award citation reads:\\nFran Allen\\'s work has had an enormous impact on compiler research and practice. Both alone and in joint work with John Cocke, she introduced many of the abstractions, algorithms, and implementations that laid the groundwork for automatic program optimization technology. Allen\\'s 1966 paper, \"Program Optimization,\" laid the conceptual basis for systematic analysis and transformation of computer programs. This paper introduced the use of graph-theoretic structures to encode program content in order to automatically and efficiently derive relationships and identify opportunities for optimization. Her 1970 papers, \"Control Flow Analysis\" and \"A Basis for Program Optimization\" established \"intervals\" as the context for efficient and effective data flow analysis and optimization. Her 1971 paper with Cocke, \"A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations,\" provided the first description and systematization of optimizing transformations. Her 1973 and 1974 papers on interprocedural data flow analysis extended the analysis to whole programs. Her 1976 paper with Cocke describes one of the two main analysis strategies used in optimizing compilers today. Allen developed and implemented her methods as part of compilers for the IBM STRETCH-HARVEST and the experimental Advanced Computing System. This work established the feasibility and structure of modern machine- and language-independent optimizers. She went on to establish and lead the PTRAN project on the automatic parallel execution of FORTRAN programs. Her PTRAN team developed new parallelism detection schemes and created the concept of the program dependence graph, the primary structuring method used by most parallelizing compilers.\\n—\\u200aAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM), Citation for the A. M. Turing Award 2006\\nAwards and honors[edit]\\nPortrait of Fran Allen receiving the Erna Hamburger Distinguished Lecture Award at EPFL, May 6, 2008\\nAllen was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). In 2000, she was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum \"for her contributions to program optimization and compiling for parallel computers\".[15] She was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1987,[16] to the American Philosophical Society in 2001,[17] and to the National Academy of Sciences in 2010.[1] She was nominated a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994.[18]\\nShe received the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award in 1997 and the Computer Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computer Society in 2004.[19] In 1997, Allen was inducted into the Witi Hall of Fame.[20] She won the 2002 Augusta Ada Lovelace Award from the Association for Women in Computing. In 2004, Allen was the winner of the ABIE Award for Technical Leadership from the Anita Borg Institute.[21][22]\\nAllen was recognized for her work in high-performance computing with the 2006 Turing Award.[9][23] She became the first woman recipient in the forty-year history of the award, which is considered the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing and is given by the Association for Computing Machinery.[24][14][25][26][27] In interviews following the award she hoped it would give more \"opportunities for women in science, computing, and engineering\".[28]\\nIn 2009 she was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree from McGill University for \"pioneering contributions to the theory and practice of optimizing compiler techniques that laid the foundation for modern optimizing compilers and automatic parallel execution\".[29]\\nPublications[edit]\\nA list of her select publications includes:[4][6]\\nAllen, Frances E.; Cocke, John (1971).

Ceruzzi はリッチーの死について「リッチーはレーダーの下にいた。彼は有名人というわけでは全くないが、…あなたが顕微鏡でコンピュータの中を見ることができたなら、彼の仕事をあらゆる箇所で見つけるだろう」と述べている[20]。\\nリッチーの死後間もなく行われたインタビューで長年の同僚だったブライアン・カーニハンは、リッチーはC言語がこれほど重要なものになるとは全く思っていなかったと述べている[21]。カーニハンは、CとUNIXがiPhoneなどの後世の重要プロジェクトでいかに大きな役割を果たしたかを述べている[22][23]。\\n他にもリッチーの後世への影響について、様々なことが言われている[24][25][26][27]。\\nFedora 16 というLinuxディストリビューションはリッチーの死後1カ月ほどでリリースされており、リッチーへの献辞が添えられていた[28]。2012年1月12日にリリースされた FreeBSD 9.0 にもリッチーへの献辞が添えられている[29]。\\n主な著書[編集]\\nUnix Programmer\\'s Manual （1971年）\\nプログラミング言語C - The C Programming Language (\"K&R\") （1978年、共著: ブライアン・カーニハン、日本語訳: 石田晴久）\\n脚注[編集]\\n^ a b Augusto Campos (2011年10月12日). “Dennis Ritchie, 1941 - 2011”. 2011年10月13日閲覧。\\n^ a b c d Lohr, Steve (October 12, 2011), “Dennis Ritchie, Programming Trailblazer, Dies at 70”, The New York Times 2011年10月13日閲覧, \"Dennis M.

His dissertation \\'Traffic Control in a Multiplexed System\\' was advised by Fernando Corbató.[3] In 1966, he joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.\\nOne of Saltzer\\'s earliest involvements with computers was with MIT\\'s Compatible Time-Sharing System in the early 1960s. In the later 1960s and early 1970s, he was one of the team leaders of the Multics operating system project. Multics, though not particularly commercially successful in itself, has had a major impact on all subsequent operating systems; in particular, it was an inspiration for Ken Thompson to develop Unix. Saltzer\\'s contributions to Multics included the now-standard kernel stack switching method of process switching, as well as oft-cited work on the security architecture for shared information systems.[4]\\nSaltzer led the Computer Systems Research group of MIT\\'s Laboratory for Computer Science. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Computer Systems Research group was one of the key players in the development of the Internet and ring network technology for local area networks. During this time, Saltzer patented the Proteon ProNet ring network. He is the co-author of The Protection of Information in Computer Systems.\\nFrom 1984 to 1988 Saltzer served as Technical Director of MIT\\'s Project Athena. \"Saltzer@mit.edu\" is one of the few Athena usernames with a capital letter, and legend has it that several special case hacks were required to support this functionality. In September 1995 Saltzer retired from his full-time faculty position, but continued writing and teaching part-time at MIT.[2]\\nFamily[edit]\\nSaltzer is known to all (colleagues, students, friends and family) as \"Jerry\". In 1961 he married Marlys Anne Hughes. They have two children: Rebecca (born 1962) and Sarah (born 1963). He has two grandchildren: Hannah (born 1997), and Caroline (born 1999).[5]\\nOther interests[edit]\\nSaltzer is also very interested in 19th century landscape art of the western United States; he has prepared the catalogue raisonné of the paintings of the painter Frederick Ferdinand Schafer (de).[6][7][8][9]\\nSoftware[edit]\\nSaltzer has been the programmer, a designer, or the inspiration, for a number of important pieces of systems software, which are either still in use or have descendants still being used today:\\nRUNOFF, a very early text-formatting program which was the basis for roff and nroff[2]\\nTYPSET, the \"Project MAC editor\", was the first interactive text editor, developed to write documentation[10]\\nPCIP,[11][12] the first TCP/IP stack for the IBM PC, which became the basis for a company called FTP Software[2]\\nKerberos, an authentication protocol, part of Project Athena, still widely used today\\nAs Technical Director of Project Athena, he supported development of the X Window System, an open-source windowing system, still used and developed on Unix-like systems.\\nReferences[edit]\\n^ \"Computer System Security Award of the National Institute of Standards and Technology\".\\n^ a b c d Saltzer, Jerome H. \"Curriculum Vitae\".

E. CalvetEugene FamaKen MusgraveMurad Taqqu\\nBenoit B. Mandelbrot[a][b] (20 November 1924 – 14 October 2010) was a Polish-born French-American mathematician and polymath with broad interests in the practical sciences, especially regarding what he labeled as \"the art of roughness\" of physical phenomena and \"the uncontrolled element in life\".[6][7][8] He referred to himself as a \"fractalist\"[9] and is recognized for his contribution to the field of fractal geometry, which included coining the word \"fractal\", as well as developing a theory of \"roughness and self-similarity\" in nature.[10]\\nIn 1936, at the age of 11, Mandelbrot and his family emigrated from Warsaw, Poland, to France. After World War II ended, Mandelbrot studied mathematics, graduating from universities in Paris and in the United States and receiving a master\\'s degree in aeronautics from the California Institute of Technology. He spent most of his career in both the United States and France, having dual French and American citizenship. In 1958, he began a 35-year career at IBM, where he became an IBM Fellow, and periodically took leaves of absence to teach at Harvard University. At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.\\nBecause of his access to IBM\\'s computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the Mandelbrot set in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\", or \"chaotic\", such as clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\".[11] His math- and geometry-centered research included contributions to such fields as statistical physics, meteorology, hydrology, geomorphology, anatomy, taxonomy, neurology, linguistics, information technology, computer graphics, economics, geology, medicine, physical cosmology, engineering, chaos theory, econophysics, metallurgy, and the social sciences.[12]\\nToward the end of his career, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Yale University, where he was the oldest professor in Yale\\'s history to receive tenure.[13] Mandelbrot also held positions at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Université Lille Nord de France, Institute for Advanced Study and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During his career, he received over 15 honorary doctorates and served on many science journals, along with winning numerous awards. His autobiography, The Fractalist: Memoir of a Scientific Maverick, was published posthumously in 2012.\\nEarly years[edit]\\nExternal videos\\nFamily background and early education, (4:11) Benoit Mandelbrot interview, Part 1 of 144, Web of Stories[14]\\nBenedykt Mandelbrot[15] was born in a Lithuanian Jewish family, in Warsaw during the Second Polish Republic.[16] His father made his living trading clothing; his mother was a dental surgeon. During his first two school years, he was tutored privately by an uncle who despised rote learning: \"Most of my time was spent playing chess, reading maps and learning how to open my eyes to everything around me.\"[17]\\nIn 1936, when he was 11, the family emigrated from Poland to France. The move, World War II, and the influence of his father\\'s brother, the mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt (who had moved to Paris around 1920), further prevented a standard education. \"The fact that my parents, as economic and political refugees, joined Szolem in France saved our lives,\" he writes.[9]:\\u200a17\\u200a[18]\\nMandelbrot attended the Lycée Rollin (now the Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour) in Paris until the start of World War II, when his family moved to Tulle, France. He was helped by Rabbi David Feuerwerker, the Rabbi of Brive-la-Gaillarde, to continue his studies.[9]:\\u200a62–63\\u200a[19] Much of France was occupied by the Nazis at the time, and Mandelbrot recalls this period:\\nOur constant fear was that a sufficiently determined foe might report us to an authority and we would be sent to our deaths. This happened to a close friend from Paris, Zina Morhange, a physician in a nearby county seat. Simply to eliminate the competition, another physician denounced her ... We escaped this fate. Who knows why?[9]:\\u200a49\\nIn 1944, Mandelbrot returned to Paris, studied at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon, and in 1945 to 1947 attended the École Polytechnique, where he studied under Gaston Julia and Paul Lévy. From 1947 to 1949 he studied at California Institute of Technology, where he earned a master\\'s degree in aeronautics.[2] Returning to France, he obtained his PhD degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Paris in 1952.[17]\\nResearch career[edit]\\nFrom 1949 to 1958, Mandelbrot was a staff member at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During this time he spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he was sponsored by John von Neumann. In 1955 he married Aliette Kagan and moved to Geneva, Switzerland (to collaborate with Jean Piaget at the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology) and later to the Université Lille Nord de France.[20] In 1958 the couple moved to the United States where Mandelbrot joined the research staff at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.[20] He remained at IBM for 35 years, becoming an IBM Fellow, and later Fellow Emeritus.[17]\\nFrom 1951 onward, Mandelbrot worked on problems and published papers not only in mathematics but in applied fields such as information theory, economics, and fluid dynamics.\\nRandomness and fractals in financial markets[edit]\\nMandelbrot saw financial markets as an example of \"wild randomness\", characterized by concentration and long-range dependence. He developed several original approaches for modelling financial fluctuations.[21] In his early work, he found that the price changes in financial markets did not follow a Gaussian distribution, but rather Lévy stable distributions having infinite variance. He found, for example, that cotton prices followed a Lévy stable distribution with parameter α equal to 1.7 rather than 2 as in a Gaussian distribution. \"Stable\" distributions have the property that the sum of many instances of a random variable follows the same distribution but with a larger scale parameter.[22] The latter work from the early 60s was done with daily data of cotton prices from 1900, long before he introduced the word \\'fractal\\'. In later years, after the concept of fractals had matured, the study of financial markets in the context of fractals became possible only after the availability of high frequency data in finance.\\nIn the late 1980s, Mandelbrot used intra-daily tick data supplied by Olsen & Associates in Zurich[23][24] to apply fractal theory to market microstructure. This cooperation led to the publication of the first comprehensive papers on scaling law in finance.[25][26] This law shows similar properties at different time scales, confirming Mandelbrot\\'s insight of the fractal nature of market microstructure. Mandelbrot\\'s own research in this area is presented in his books Fractals and Scaling in Finance[27] and The (Mis)behavior of Markets.[28]\\nDeveloping \"fractal geometry\" and the Mandelbrot set[edit]\\nAs a visiting professor at Harvard University, Mandelbrot began to study mathematical objects called Julia sets that were invariant under certain transformations of the complex plane. Building on previous work by Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou, Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the Mandelbrot set which was introduced by him in 1979.\\nMandelbrot speaking about the Mandelbrot set, during his acceptance speech for the Légion d\\'honneur in 2006\\nIn 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term fractal to describe these structures and first published his ideas in the French book Les Objets Fractals: Forme, Hasard et Dimension, later translated in 1977 as Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension.[29] According to computer scientist and physicist Stephen Wolfram, the book was a \"breakthrough\" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically \"apply fairly straightforward mathematics ... to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before\".[11] Wolfram adds that as a result of this new research, he was no longer a \"wandering scientist\", and later called him \"the father of fractals\":\\nMandelbrot ended up doing a great piece of science and identifying a much stronger and more fundamental idea—put simply, that there are some geometric shapes, which he called \"fractals\", that are equally \"rough\" at all scales. No matter how close you look, they never get simpler, much as the section of a rocky coastline you can see at your feet looks just as jagged as the stretch you can see from space.[11]\\nWolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, \"in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other, so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole. Fern leaves and Romanesque broccoli are two examples from nature.\"[11] He points out an unexpected conclusion:\\nOne might have thought that such a simple and fundamental form of regularity would have been studied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. But it was not. In fact, it rose to prominence only over the past 30 or so years—almost entirely through the efforts of one man, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.[11]\\nMandelbrot used the term \"fractal\" as it derived from the Latin word \"fractus\", defined as broken or shattered glass. Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphics computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like \"the delirious exuberance of the 1960s psychedelic art with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body\". He also saw himself as a \"would-be Kepler\", after the 17th-century scientist Johannes Kepler, who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.[30]\\nA Mandelbrot set\\nMandelbrot, however, never felt he was inventing a new idea. He described his feelings in a documentary with science writer Arthur C. Clarke:\\nExploring this set I certainly never had the feeling of invention. I never had the feeling that my imagination was rich enough to invent all those extraordinary things on discovering them. They were there, even though nobody had seen them before. It\\'s marvelous, a very simple formula explains all these very complicated things. So the goal of science is starting with a mess, and explaining it with a simple formula, a kind of dream of science.[31]\\nAccording to Clarke, \"the Mandelbrot set is indeed one of the most astonishing discoveries in the entire history of mathematics. Who could have dreamed that such an incredibly simple equation could have generated images of literally infinite complexity?\" Clarke also notes an \"odd coincidence\":\\nthe name Mandelbrot, and the word \"mandala\"—for a religious symbol—which I\\'m sure is a pure coincidence, but indeed the Mandelbrot set does seem to contain an enormous number of mandalas.[31]\\nIn 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in The Fractal Geometry of Nature.[32] This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as \"program artifacts\".\\nMandelbrot left IBM in 1987, after 35 years and 12 days, when IBM decided to end pure research in his division.[33] He joined the Department of Mathematics at Yale, and obtained his first tenured post in 1999, at the age of 75.[34] At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences.\\nFractals and the \"theory of roughness\"[edit]\\nMandelbrot created the first-ever \"theory of roughness\", and he saw \"roughness\" in the shapes of mountains, coastlines and river basins; the structures of plants, blood vessels and lungs; the clustering of galaxies. His personal quest was to create some mathematical formula to measure the overall \"roughness\" of such objects in nature.[9]:\\u200axi\\u200a He began by asking himself various kinds of questions related to nature:\\nCan geometry deliver what the Greek root of its name [geo-] seemed to promise—truthful measurement, not only of cultivated fields along the Nile River but also of untamed Earth?[9]:\\u200axii\\nIn his paper \"How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension\", published in Science in 1967, Mandelbrot discusses self-similar curves that have Hausdorff dimension that are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975. The paper is one of Mandelbrot\\'s first publications on the topic of fractals.[35][36]\\nMandelbrot emphasized the use of fractals as realistic and useful models for describing many \"rough\" phenomena in the real world. He concluded that \"real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.\"[9]:\\u200a296\\u200a Although Mandelbrot coined the term \"fractal\", some of the mathematical objects he presented in The Fractal Geometry of Nature had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, \"rough\" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:\\nThe form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer ... bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling ... and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.[9]:\\u200a292\\nFractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and in the financial field. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional Euclidean geometry:\\nClouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.\\n  —Mandelbrot, in his introduction to The Fractal Geometry of Nature\\nSection of a Mandelbrot set\\nMandelbrot has been called an artist, and a visionary[37] and a maverick.[38] His informal and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made The Fractal Geometry of Nature accessible to non-specialists. The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics.\\nMandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of Olbers\\' paradox (the \"dark night sky\" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a sufficient, but not necessary, resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the stars in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like Cantor dust), it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bang theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.[39]\\nAwards and honors[edit]\\nMandelbrot\\'s awards include the Wolf Prize for Physics in 1993, the Lewis Fry Richardson Prize of the European Geophysical Society in 2000, the Japan Prize in 2003,[40] and the Einstein Lectureship of the American Mathematical Society in 2006.\\nThe small asteroid 27500 Mandelbrot was named in his honor. In November 1990, he was made a Chevalier in France\\'s Legion of Honour. In December 2005, Mandelbrot was appointed to the position of Battelle Fellow at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.[41] Mandelbrot was promoted to an Officer of the Legion of Honour in January 2006.[42] An honorary degree from Johns Hopkins University was bestowed on Mandelbrot in the May 2010 commencement exercises.[43]\\nA partial list of awards received by Mandelbrot:[44]\\n2004 Best Business Book of the Year Award\\nAMS Einstein Lectureship\\nBarnard Medal\\nCaltech Service\\nCasimir Funk Natural Sciences Award\\nCharles Proteus Steinmetz Medal\\nHigh School Spelling Bee (1940)\\nFellow, American Geophysical Union\\nFellow of the American Statistical Association[45]\\nFellow of the American Physical Society (1987) [46]\\nFranklin Medal\\nHarvey Prize (1989)\\nHonda Prize\\nHumboldtpreis\\nIBM Fellowship\\nJapan Prize (2003)\\nJohn Scott Award\\nLégion d\\'honneur (Legion of Honour)\\nLewis Fry Richardson Medal\\nMedaglia della Presidenza della Repubblica Italiana\\nMédaille de Vermeil de la Ville de Paris\\nNevada Prize\\nMember of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[47]\\nMember of the American Philosophical Society (2004) [48]\\nScience for Art\\nSven Berggren-Priset\\nWacław Sierpiński medal of the Polish Mathematical Society (2005) [49]\\nWładysław Orlicz Prize\\nWolf Foundation Prize for Physics (1993)\\nDeath and legacy[edit]\\nMandelbrot died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 85 in a hospice in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 14 October 2010.[1][50] Reacting to news of his death, mathematician Heinz-Otto Peitgen said: \"[I]f we talk about impact inside mathematics, and applications in the sciences, he is one of the most important figures of the last fifty years.\"[1]\\nChris Anderson, TED conference curator, described Mandelbrot as \"an icon who changed how we see the world\".[51] Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France at the time of Mandelbrot\\'s death, said Mandelbrot had \"a powerful, original mind that never shied away from innovating and shattering preconceived notions [... h]is work, developed entirely outside mainstream research, led to modern information theory.\"[52] Mandelbrot\\'s obituary in The Economist points out his fame as \"celebrity beyond the academy\" and lauds him as the \"father of fractal geometry\".[53]\\nBest-selling essayist-author Nassim Nicholas Taleb has remarked that Mandelbrot\\'s book The (Mis)Behavior of Markets is in his opinion \"The deepest and most realistic finance book ever published\".[10]\\nBibliography[edit]\\nIn English[edit]\\nFractals: Form, Chance and Dimension, 1977, 2020\\nThe Fractal Geometry of Nature, 1982\\nMandelbrot, Benoît B.

For the C# IDE, see Turbo C Sharp.\\nBorland Turbo C\\nDeveloper(s) Borland\\nInitial release 1987; 37 years ago\\nOperating system Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS\\nSuccessor Turbo C++\\nBorland C++\\nType IDE\\nLicense Proprietary software\\nInstallation disk of Turbo C 1.5\\nTurbo C is a discontinued integrated development environment (IDE) and compiler for the C programming language from Borland. First introduced in 1987, it was noted for its integrated development environment, small size, fast compile speed, comprehensive manuals and low price.\\nIn May 1990, Borland replaced Turbo C with Turbo C++. In 2006, Borland reintroduced the Turbo moniker.\\nEarly history[edit]\\nIn the early 1980s, Borland enjoyed considerable success with their Turbo Pascal product and it became a popular choice when developing applications for the PC. Borland followed up that success by releasing Turbo Prolog (in 1986), and in 1987, Turbo Basic and Turbo C. Turbo C has similar properties to Turbo Pascal: an integrated development environment, a fast compiler (though not near the speed of Turbo Pascal),[1] a good editor, and a competitive price.\\nTurbo C competed with other professional programming tools, such as Microsoft C, Watcom C,[2] and Lattice C, while Turbo Pascal was successful with hobbyists and schools as well as professional programmers.\\nVersion history[edit]\\nVersion 1.0 (May 13, 1987) offered the first integrated development environment for C on IBM PCs. Like many Borland products of the time, the software was bought from another company (in this case Wizard C compiler by Bob Jervis[3]), and branded with the \"Turbo\" name. It ran in 384 kB of memory. It allowed inline assembly with full access to C symbolic names and structures, supported all memory models, and offered optimizations for speed, size, constant folding, and jump elimination.[4]\\nVersion 1.5 (January 1988) was an incremental improvement over version 1.0. It included more sample programs, improved manuals and bug fixes. It was shipped on five 360 KB diskettes of uncompressed files, and came with sample C programs, including a stripped down spreadsheet called mcalc. This version introduced the <conio.h> header file (which provided fast, PC-specific console I/O routines).\\nVersion 2.0 (late 1988) featured the first \"blue screen\" version, which would be typical of all future Borland releases for MS-DOS. It was also available bundled with Turbo Assembler and Turbo Debugger. Turbo C 2.0 was also released (in Germany only) for the Atari ST; the program was not maintained by Borland, but sold and renamed PureC. This version introduced the <graphics.h> header file, which provided the Borland Graphics Interface already included in Turbo Pascal.\\nWith the release of Turbo C++ 1.0 (in 1990), the two products were folded into one and the name \"Turbo C\" was discontinued. The C++ compiler was developed under contract by a company in San Diego, and was one of the first \"true\" compilers for C++ (until then, it was common to use pre-compilers that generated C code, ref. Cfront).\\nFreeware release[edit]\\nIn 2006,[citation needed] Borland\\'s successor, Embarcadero Technologies, re-released Turbo C and the MS-DOS versions of the Turbo C++ compilers as freeware.[5][6][7]\\nReception[edit]\\nBYTE in January 1989 listed Turbo C and Turbo Pascal as among the \"Distinction\" winners of the BYTE Awards. Citing their user interface and continued emphasis on speed, the magazine stated that \"for rapid prototyping there\\'s not much better\".[8] In a February 1989 overview of optimizing C compilers, BYTE said that Turbo C Professional 2.0 \"is no exception\" to the company\\'s \"well-deserved reputation for pricing good software\". The magazine reported that Turbo C \"compiles faster—much faster—than any other compiler we reviewed\", and praised the addition of Turbo Debugger (\"the best source debugger\"). BYTE concluded that Turbo C did not produce the fastest or smallest executable, \"but it\\'s definitely the one that is most fun to use\".[2]\\nSee also[edit]\\nTurbo Assembler\\nTurbo Debugger\\nReferences[edit]\\n^ Hague, James. \"A Personal History of Compilation Speed, Part 2\".

His contributions include the Hamming code (which makes use of a Hamming matrix), the Hamming window, Hamming numbers, sphere-packing (or Hamming bound), Hamming graph concepts, and the Hamming distance.\\nBorn in Chicago, Hamming attended University of Chicago, University of Nebraska and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he wrote his doctoral thesis in mathematics under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky (1901–1973). In April 1945, he joined the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he programmed the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the project\\'s physicists. He left to join the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1946. Over the next fifteen years, he was involved in nearly all of the laboratories\\' most prominent achievements. For his work, he received the Turing Award in 1968, being its third recipient.[1]\\nAfter retiring from the Bell Labs in 1976, Hamming took a position at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science, and devoted himself to teaching and writing books. He delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before he died from a heart attack on January 7, 1998.\\nEarly life[edit]\\nHamming was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 11, 1915,[2] the son of Richard J. Hamming, a credit manager, and Mabel G. Redfield.[3] His father was Dutch, and his mother was a Mayflower descendant.[4] He grew up in Chicago, where he attended Crane Technical High School and Crane Junior College.[3]\\nHamming initially wanted to study engineering, but money was scarce during the Great Depression, and the only scholarship offer he received came from the University of Chicago, which had no engineering school. Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics,[5] and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937.[2] He later considered this a fortunate turn of events. \"As an engineer,\" he said, \"I would have been the guy going down manholes instead of having the excitement of frontier research work.\"[2]\\nHe went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1939, and then entered the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he wrote his doctoral thesis on Some Problems in the Boundary Value Theory of Linear Differential Equations under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky.[5] His thesis was an extension of Trjitzinsky\\'s work in that area. He looked at Green\\'s function and further developed Jacob Tamarkin\\'s methods for obtaining characteristic solutions.[6] While he was a graduate student, he discovered and read George Boole\\'s The Laws of Thought.[7]\\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign awarded Hamming his Doctor of Philosophy in 1942, and he became an instructor in mathematics there. He married Wanda Little, a fellow student, on September 5, 1942,[5] immediately after she was awarded her own Master of Arts in English literature. They would remain married until his death, and had no children.[3] In 1944, he became an assistant professor at the J.B. Speed Scientific School at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.[5]\\nManhattan Project[edit]\\nWith World War II still ongoing, Hamming left Louisville in April 1945 to work on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, in Hans Bethe\\'s division, programming the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the project\\'s physicists. His wife Wanda soon followed, taking a job at Los Alamos as a human computer, working for Bethe and Edward Teller.[5] Hamming later recalled that:\\nShortly before the first field test (you realize that no small scale experiment can be done—either you have a critical mass or you do not), a man asked me to check some arithmetic he had done, and I agreed, thinking to fob it off on some subordinate. When I asked what it was, he said, \"It is the probability that the test bomb will ignite the whole atmosphere.\" I decided I would check it myself! The next day when he came for the answers I remarked to him, \"The arithmetic was apparently correct but I do not know about the formulas for the capture cross sections for oxygen and nitrogen—after all, there could be no experiments at the needed energy levels.\" He replied, like a physicist talking to a mathematician, that he wanted me to check the arithmetic not the physics, and left. I said to myself, \"What have you done, Hamming, you are involved in risking all of life that is known in the Universe, and you do not know much of an essential part?\" I was pacing up and down the corridor when a friend asked me what was bothering me. I told him. His reply was, \"Never mind, Hamming, no one will ever blame you.\"[7]\\nHamming remained at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a post at the Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs\\'s old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming.[3] Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a \"computer janitor\",[8] he saw computer simulations of experiments that would have been impossible to perform in a laboratory. \"And when I had time to think about it,\" he later recalled, \"I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed\".[2]\\nBell Laboratories[edit]\\nA two-dimensional visualisation of the Hamming distance. The color of each pixel indicates the Hamming distance between the binary representations of its x and y coordinates, modulo 16, in the 16-color system.\\nAt the Bell Labs Hamming shared an office for a time with Claude Shannon. The Mathematical Research Department also included John Tukey and Los Alamos veterans Donald Ling and Brockway McMillan. Shannon, Ling, McMillan and Hamming came to call themselves the Young Turks.[5] \"We were first-class troublemakers,\" Hamming later recalled. \"We did unconventional things in unconventional ways and still got valuable results. Thus management had to tolerate us and let us alone a lot of the time.\"[2]\\nAlthough Hamming had been hired to work on elasticity theory, he still spent much of his time with the calculating machines.[8] Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off.[9] Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen \"bits\".[10] If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. \"If the computer can tell when an error has occurred,\" Hamming reasoned, \"surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself.\"[9]\\nHamming set himself the task of solving this problem,[3] which he realised would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept of the number of positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance.[11] Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting codes, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.[11][12]\\nThe Hamming bound, also known as the sphere-packing or volume bound is a limit on the parameters of an arbitrary block code. It is from an interpretation in terms of sphere packing in the Hamming distance into the space of all possible words. It gives an important limitation on the efficiency with which any error-correcting code can utilize the space in which its code words are embedded. A code which attains the Hamming bound is said to be a perfect code. Hamming codes are perfect codes.[13][14]\\nReturning to differential equations, Hamming studied means of numerically integrating them. A popular approach at the time was Milne\\'s Method, attributed to Arthur Milne.[15] This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method.[16] He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).[17]\\nDuring the 1950s, he programmed one of the earliest computers, the IBM 650, and with Ruth A. Weiss developed the L2 programming language, one of the earliest computer languages, in 1956. It was widely used within the Bell Labs, and also by external users, who knew it as Bell 2. It was superseded by Fortran when the Bell Labs\\' IBM 650 were replaced by the IBM 704 in 1957.[18]\\nIn A Discipline of Programming (1976), Edsger Dijkstra attributed to Hamming the problem of efficiently finding regular numbers.[19] The problem became known as \"Hamming\\'s problem\", and the regular numbers are often referred to as Hamming numbers in Computer Science, although he did not discover them.[20]\\nThroughout his time at Bell Labs, Hamming avoided management responsibilities. He was promoted to management positions several times, but always managed to make these only temporary. \"I knew in a sense that by avoiding management,\" he later recalled, \"I was not doing my duty by the organization. That is one of my biggest failures.\"[2]\\nLater life[edit]\\nHamming served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery from 1958 to 1960.[8] In 1960, he predicted that one day half of the Bell Labs budget would be spent on computing. None of his colleagues thought that it would ever be so high, but his forecast actually proved to be too low.[21] His philosophy on scientific computing appeared as the motto of his Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers (1962):\\nThe purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.[22]\\nIn later life, Hamming became interested in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, when he left Bell Labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, Stevens Institute of Technology, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University.[23] As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs\\' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed in the first half of his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.[2]\\nIn 1976 he moved to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science.[3] He gave up research, and concentrated on teaching and writing books.[5] He noted that:\\nThe way mathematics is currently taught it is exceedingly dull. In the calculus book we are currently using on my campus, I found no single problem whose answer I felt the student would care about! The problems in the text have the dignity of solving a crossword puzzle – hard to be sure, but the result is of no significance in life.[5]\\nHamming attempted to rectify the situation with a new text, Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics (1985).[5] In 1993, he remarked that \"when I left BTL, I knew that that was the end of my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it\\'s really the end.\"[2] And so it proved. He became Professor Emeritus in June 1997,[24] and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before his death from a heart attack on January 7, 1998.[8] He was survived by his wife Wanda.[24]\\nHamming\\'s final recorded lecture series[25] is maintained by Naval Postgraduate School along with ongoing work[26] that preserves his insights and extends his legacy.\\nAwards and professional recognition[edit]\\nTuring Award, Association for Computing Machinery, 1968.[27]\\nIEEE Emanuel R.

The Phoronix Test Suite, developed by Michael Larabel and Matthew Tippett, has been endorsed by sites such as Linux.com,[2] LinuxPlanet,[3] and Softpedia.[4]\\nFeatures[edit]\\nPhoronix Test Suite supports over 220 test profiles and over 60 test suites. It uses an XML-based testing architecture. Tests available to use include MEncoder, FFmpeg and lm sensors, along with OpenGL games such as Doom 3, Nexuiz, and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, and many more.[5] The suite also contains a feature called PTS Global where users may upload their test results and system information for sharing. By executing a single command, other users can compare their test results to a selected system in an easy-comparison mode.[6] Before 2014, these benchmark results could be uploaded to the Phoronix Global online database, but since 2013, these benchmark results can be uploaded to openbenchmarking.org.[7] Phoronix supports automated Git bisecting on a performance basis to find performance regressions, and features statistical significance verification.\\nComponents[edit]\\nPhoromatic[edit]\\nPhoromatic is a web-based remote test management system for the Phoronix Test Suite. It allows the automatic scheduling of tests. It\\'s aimed at the enterprise. It can manage multiple test nodes simultaneously within a test farm or distributed environment.\\nPhoromatic Tracker[edit]\\nPhoromatic Tracker is an extension of Phoromatic that provides a public interface into test farms.[8] Currently, their reference implementations autonomously monitor the performance of the Linux kernel on a daily basis,[9] Fedora Rawhide,[10] and Ubuntu.[11]\\nPTS Desktop Live[edit]\\nPTS Desktop Live was a stripped-down x86-64 Linux distribution, which included Phoronix Test Suite 2.4. It was designed for testing/benchmarking computers from a LiveDVD / LiveUSB environment.[12]\\nPhodevi[edit]\\nPhodevi (Phoronix Device Interface) is a library that provides a clean, stable, platform-independent API for accessing software and hardware information.[13]\\nPCQS[edit]\\nPhoronix Certification & Qualification Suite (PCQS) is a reference specification for the Phoronix Test Suite.\\nPhoronix website[edit]\\nPhoronix\\nPhoronix logo and screenshot\\nType of site Review\\nAvailable in English\\nCreated by Michael Larabel\\nURL phoronix.com\\nCommercial Yes\\nRegistration Required (for the forums)\\nLaunched June 5, 2004; 20 years ago\\nCurrent status Active\\nPhoronix is a technology website that offers information on the development of the Linux kernel, product reviews, interviews, and news regarding free and open-source software by monitoring the Linux kernel mailing list or interviews.\\nPhoronix was started in June 2004 by Michael Larabel, who currently serves as the owner and editor-in-chief.\\nHistory[edit]\\nFounded on June 5, 2004,[14] Phoronix started as a website with a handful of hardware reviews and guides,[15][16] moving to articles covering operating systems based on Linux and open-source software such as Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE,[17] and Mozilla (Firefox/Thunderbird) around the start of 2005.[18] Phoronix focuses on benchmarking hardware running Linux, with a slant toward graphics articles that monitor and compare free and open-source graphics device drivers and Mesa 3D with AMD\\'s and Nvidia\\'s proprietary graphics device drivers. In June 2006, the website added forums to accompany news content.[19] On April 20, 2007, Phoronix redesigned its website and began publishing Solaris hardware reviews and news in addition to Linux content.[20][21]\\nOther technical publications, such as CNET News, have cited Phoronix benchmarks.[22][23]\\nOpen Benchmarking[edit]\\nOpenBenchmarking.org is a web-based service created to work with the Phoronix Test Suite. It is a collaborative platform that allows users to share their hardware and software benchmarks through an organized online interface.[24]\\nIt is primarily used for performance benchmarking and testing hardware/software performance, typically in the context of Linux-based systems (unlike SoapUI, which is used for testing web services).[25]\\nRelease history[edit]\\nOn June 5, 2008, Phoronix Test Suite 1.0 was released under the codename Trondheim.[26] This 1.0 release was made up of 57 test profiles and 23 test suites.[27]\\nOn September 3, 2008, Phoronix Test Suite 1.2 was released with support for the OpenSolaris operating system,[28] a module framework accompanied by tests focusing upon new areas,[29] and new test profiles.\\nPhoronix Test Suite 1.8 includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using GTK+ written using the PHP-GTK bindings.\\n3.4 includes MATISK benchmarking module and initial support for the GNU Hurd.\\nSee also[edit]\\nPortals:\\nLinux\\nFree and open-source software\\nInquisitor\\nStresslinux\\nReferences[edit]\\n^ \"Release History\", Phoronix Test Suite, retrieved July 24, 2022\\n^ \"Phoronix Test Suite brings Linux benchmarking to the desktop\".

      "Alfred Vaino Aho (born August 9, 1941) is a Canadian computer scientist best known for his work on programming languages, compilers, and related algorithms, and his textbooks on the art and science of computer programming.[2][3][4]\n",
      "Aho was elected into the National Academy of Engineering in 1999 for his contributions to the fields of algorithms and programming tools.\n",
      "He and his long-time collaborator Jeffrey Ullman are the recipients of the 2020 Turing Award, generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.[5]\n",
      "Career[edit]\n",
      "Aho received a B.A.Sc. (1963) in Engineering Physics from the University of Toronto, then an M.A. (1965) and Ph.D. (1967) in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science from Princeton University.[6] He conducted research at Bell Labs from 1967 to 1991, and again from 1997 to 2002 as Vice President of the Computing Sciences Research Center.[7] Since 1995, he has held the Lawrence Gussman Professorship in Computer Science at Columbia University. He served as chair of the department from 1995 to 1997, and again in the spring of 2003.[8]\n",
      "In his PhD thesis Aho created indexed grammars[9] and the nested-stack automaton[10] as vehicles for extending the power of context-free languages, but retaining many of their decidability and closure properties. One application of indexed grammars is modelling parallel rewriting systems,[11] particularly in biological applications.[12]\n",
      "After graduating from Princeton, Aho joined the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs where he devised efficient regular expression and string-pattern matching algorithms that he implemented in the first versions of the Unix tools egrep and fgrep. The fgrep algorithm has become known as the Aho–Corasick algorithm; it is used by several bibliographic search-systems, including the one developed by Margaret J. Corasick, and by other string-searching applications.[13]\n",
      "At Bell Labs, Aho worked closely with Steve Johnson and Jeffrey Ullman to develop efficient algorithms for analyzing and translating programming languages.[14] Steve Johnson used the bottom-up LALR parsing algorithms to create the syntax-analyzer generator yacc,[15] and Michael E. Lesk and Eric Schmidt used Aho's regular-expression pattern-matching algorithms to create the lexical-analyzer generator lex.[16] The lex and yacc tools and their derivatives have been used to develop the front ends of many of today's programming language compilers.[17]\n",
      "Aho and Ullman wrote a series of textbooks on compiling techniques that codified the theory relevant to compiler design. Their 1977 textbook Principles of Compiler Design had a green dragon on the front cover and became known as \"the green dragon book\". In 1986 Aho and Ullman were joined by Ravi Sethi to create a new edition, \"the red dragon book\" (which was briefly shown in the 1995 movie Hackers), and in 2006 also by Monica Lam to create \"the purple dragon book\". The dragon books are used for university courses as well as industry references.[18]\n",
      "In 1974, Aho, John Hopcroft, and Ullman wrote The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms,[19] codifying some of their early research on algorithms. This book became one of the most highly cited books in computer science for several decades and helped to stimulate the creation of algorithms and data structures as a central course in the computer science curriculum.[20]\n",
      "Aho is also widely known for his co-authorship of the AWK programming language with Peter J. Weinberger and Brian Kernighan (the \"A\" stands for \"Aho\").[21] As of 2010 Aho's research interests include programming languages, compilers, algorithms, and quantum computing. He is part of the Language and Compilers research-group at Columbia University.[22]\n",
      "Overall, his works have been cited 81,040 times and he has an h-index of 66, as of May 8, 2019.[23]\n",
      "Aho has received many prestigious honors, including the IEEE's John von Neumann Medal and membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003.[24] He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Waterloo,[25] from the University of Helsinki,[25] and from the University of Toronto.[26] He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ACM, Bell Labs, and IEEE.[20]\n",
      "Aho has twice served as chair of the Advisory Committee for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation. He is a past president of the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computability Theory.[27] Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman were co-recipients of the 2017 C&C Prize awarded by NEC Corporation.[28] He and Ullman were named recipients of the 2020 Turing Award on March 31, 2021.[5]\n",
      "Teaching[edit]\n",
      "Aho has taught at Columbia University in New York City since 1995. He won the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates in 2003.[29][30]\n",

Doctoral students Krysta Svore Gaurav Kc Marc Eaddy Marcio Buss Alfred Vaino Aho born August 9 1941 is a Canadian computer scientist best known for his work on programming languages compilers and related algorithms and his textbooks on the art and science of computer programming234 Aho was elected into the National Academy of Engineering in 1999 for his contributions to the fields of algorithms and programming tools He and his longtime collaborator Jeffrey Ullman are the recipients of the 2020 Turing Award generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science5 Careeredit Aho received a BASc 1963 in Engineering Physics from the University of Toronto then an MA 1965 and PhD 1967 in Electrical EngineeringComputer Science from Princeton University6 He conducted research at Bell Labs from 1967 to 1991 and again from 1997 to 2002 as Vice President of the Computing Sciences Research Center7 Since 1995 he has held the Lawrence Gussman Professorship in Computer Science at Columbia University He served as chair of the department from 1995 to 1997 and again in the spring of 20038 In his PhD thesis Aho created indexed grammars9 and the nestedstack automaton10 as vehicles for extending the power of contextfree languages but retaining many of their decidability and closure properties One application of indexed grammars is modelling parallel rewriting systems11 particularly in biological applications12 After graduating from Princeton Aho joined the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs where he devised efficient regular expression and stringpattern matching algorithms that he implemented in the first versions of the Unix tools egrep and fgrep The fgrep algorithm has become known as the AhoCorasick algorithm it is used by several bibliographic searchsystems including the one developed by Margaret J Corasick and by other stringsearching applications13 At Bell Labs Aho worked closely with Steve Johnson and Jeffrey Ullman to develop efficient algorithms for analyzing and translating programming languages14 Steve Johnson used the bottomup LALR parsing algorithms to create the syntaxanalyzer generator yacc15 and Michael E Lesk and Eric Schmidt used Ahos regularexpression patternmatching algorithms to create the lexicalanalyzer generator lex16 The lex and yacc tools and their derivatives have been used to develop the front ends of many of todays programming language compilers17 Aho and Ullman wrote a series of textbooks on compiling techniques that codified the theory relevant to compiler design Their 1977 textbook Principles of Compiler Design had a green dragon on the front cover and became known as the green dragon book In 1986 Aho and Ullman were joined by Ravi Sethi to create a new edition the red dragon book which was briefly shown in the 1995 movie Hackers and in 2006 also by Monica Lam to create the purple dragon book The dragon books are used for university courses as well as industry references18 In 1974 Aho John Hopcroft and Ullman wrote The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms19 codifying some of their early research on algorithms This book became one of the most highly cited books in computer science for several decades and helped to stimulate the creation of algorithms and data structures as a central course in the computer science curriculum20 Aho is also widely known for his coauthorship of the AWK programming language with Peter J Weinberger and Brian Kernighan the A stands for Aho21 As of 2010 Ahos research interests include programming languages compilers algorithms and quantum computing He is part of the Language and Compilers researchgroup at Columbia University22 Overall his works have been cited 81040 times and he has an hindex of 66 as of May 8 201923 Aho has received many prestigious honors including the IEEEs John von Neumann Medal and membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 200324 He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Waterloo25 from the University of Helsinki25 and from the University of Toronto26 He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ACM Bell Labs and IEEE20 Aho has twice served as chair of the Advisory Committee for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation He is a past president of the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computability Theory27 Aho Hopcroft and Ullman were corecipients of the 2017 CC Prize awarded by NEC Corporation28 He and Ullman were named recipients of the 2020 Turing Award on March 31 20215 Teachingedit Aho has taught at Columbia University in New York City
