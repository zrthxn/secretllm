      "Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.[3] He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B language.[3] Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1983, the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1990, and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999.\n",
      "Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.\n",
      "Early life and education[edit]\n",
      "Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime Bell Labs scientist and co-author of The Design of Switching Circuits[4] on switching circuit theory.[5] As a child, Dennis moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey, where he graduated from Summit High School.[6] He graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics and applied mathematics in 1963.[5]\n",
      "Career[edit]\n",
      "Ken Thompson (left) and Dennis Ritchie (right), in 1973\n",
      "Version 7 Unix for the PDP-11, including Dennis Ritchie's home directory: /usr/dmr\n",
      "In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center. In 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on \"Computational Complexity and Program Structure\" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard library, a requirement for the degree.[7][8] In 2020, the Computer History Museum worked with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found a copy of the lost dissertation.[8][9]\n",
      "During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, Brian Kernighan suggested the name \"Unix\", a pun on the name \"Multics\".[10] To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many years.[11]\n",
      "During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.[12] Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security Agency, the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle applied to machines still in use by foreign governments.[12]\n",
      "Ritchie was also involved with the development of the operating systems Plan 9 and Inferno, and the programming language Limbo.\n",
      "As part of an AT&T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.[13]\n",
      "C and Unix[edit]\n",
      "Usenix conference, 1984\n",
      "Ritchie conversing in a chalet in the mountains surrounding Salt Lake City\n",
      "Ritchie, standing in middle, in a striped sweater, behind Steven Bellovin in a baseball cap\n",
      "Ritchie created the C programming language and was one of the developers of the Unix operating system. With Brian Kernighan, he co-wrote the book The C Programming Language, which is often referred to as K&R after their initials. Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchie's contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.[14] They were so influential on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, \"The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed.\"[15]\n",
      "Nowadays, the C language is widely used in application, operating system, and embedded system development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. C is a low-level language with constructs closely translating to the hardware's instruction set. However, it is not tied to any given hardware, making it easy to write programs on any machine that supports C.[16] Moreover, C is a high-level programming language with constructs mapping to data structures in application software.\n",
      "C influenced several other languages and derivatives, such as C++, Objective-C used by Apple, C# used by Microsoft, and Java used in corporate environments extensively and by Android. Ritchie and Thompson used C to write Unix, which has been influential in establishing many computing concepts and principles that are adopted widely.\n",
      "In an interview from 1999, Ritchie clarified that he saw Linux and Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating systems as a continuation of the basis of the Unix operating system, and as derivatives of Unix:[17]\n",
      "I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful, because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided. Linux seems to be among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers.\n",
      "In the same interview, he stated that he viewed Unix and Linux as \"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago.\"[17]\n",
      "Awards[edit]\n",
      "In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award \"for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system\".[18] Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled \"Reflections on Software Research\".[19] In 1990, both Ritchie and Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), \"for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language\".[20]\n",
      "In 1997, both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, \"for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language.\"[21]\n",
      "On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, \"led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age\".[22][23]\n",
      "In 2005, the Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.[24]\n",
      "In 2011, Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.[25]\n",
      "Death[edit]\n",
      "Dennis Ritchie (right) with Doug McIlroy (left) in May 2011\n",
      "Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone.[3] First news of his death came from his former colleague, Rob Pike.[26][27][28] He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease.[3][26][29][30] News of Ritchie's death was largely overshadowed by the media coverage of the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, which occurred the week before.[31]\n",
      "Legacy[edit]\n",
      "Following Ritchie's death, computer historian Paul E. Ceruzzi stated:[32]\n",
      "Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside.\n",
      "In an interview shortly after Ritchie's death, long-time colleague Brian Kernighan said Ritchie never expected C to be so significant.[33] Kernighan told The New York Times \"The tools that Dennis built—and their direct descendants—run pretty much everything today.\"[34] Kernighan reminded readers of how important a role C and Unix had played in the development of later high-profile projects, such as the iPhone.[35][36] Other testimonials to his influence followed.[37][38][39][40]\n",
      "Reflecting upon his death, a commentator compared the relative importance of Steve Jobs and Ritchie, concluding that \"[Ritchie's] work played a key role in spawning the technological revolution of the last forty years—including technology on which Apple went on to build its fortune.\"[41] Another commentator said, \"Ritchie, on the other hand, invented and co-invented two key software technologies which make up the DNA of effectively every single computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the modern age. It sounds like a wild claim, but it really is true.\"[42] Another said, \"many in computer science and related fields knew of Ritchie's importance to the growth and development of, well, everything to do with computing,...\"[43]\n",
      "The Fedora 16 Linux distribution, which was released about a month after he died, was dedicated to his memory.[44] FreeBSD 9.0, released January 12, 2012, was also dedicated in his memory.[45]\n",
      "Asteroid 294727 Dennisritchie, discovered by astronomers Tom Glinos and David H. Levy in 2008, was named in his memory.[46] The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 7 February 2012 (Minor Planet Circulars (M.P.C.) 78272).[47]\n",

      "The Berkeley Software Distribution or Berkeley Standard Distribution[1] (BSD) is a discontinued operating system based on Research Unix, developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley. Since the original has become obsolete, the term \"BSD\" is commonly used for its open-source descendants, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD.\n",
      "BSD was initially called Berkeley Unix because it was based on the source code of the original Unix developed at Bell Labs. In the 1980s, BSD was widely adopted by workstation vendors in the form of proprietary Unix variants such as DEC Ultrix and Sun Microsystems SunOS due to its permissive licensing and familiarity to many technology company founders and engineers. These proprietary BSD derivatives were largely superseded in the 1990s by UNIX SVR4 and OSF/1.\n",
      "Later releases of BSD provided the basis for several open-source operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Darwin and TrueOS. These, in turn, have been used by proprietary operating systems, including Apple's macOS and iOS, which derived from them[2] and Microsoft Windows (since at least 2000 and XP), which used (at least) part of its TCP/IP code, which was legal.[3][better source needed] Code from FreeBSD was also used to create the operating systems for the PlayStation 5,[4] PlayStation 4,[5] PlayStation 3,[6] PlayStation Vita,[7] and Nintendo Switch.[8][9]\n",
      "History[edit]\n",
      "Main article: History of the Berkeley Software Distribution\n",
      "Simplified evolution of Unix systems. Not shown are Junos, PlayStation 3 system software and other proprietary forks.\n",
      "The earliest distributions of Unix from Bell Labs in the 1970s included the source code to the operating system, allowing researchers at universities to modify and extend Unix. The operating system arrived at Berkeley in 1974, at the request of computer science professor Bob Fabry who had been on the program committee for the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles where Unix was first presented. A PDP-11/45 was bought to run the system, but for budgetary reasons, this machine was shared with the mathematics and statistics groups at Berkeley, who used RSTS, so that Unix only ran on the machine eight hours per day (sometimes during the day, sometimes during the night). A larger PDP-11/70 was installed at Berkeley the following year, using money from the Ingres database project.[10]\n",
      "BSD began life as a variant of Unix that programmers at the University of California at Berkeley, initially led by Bill Joy, began developing in the late 1970s. It included extra features, which were intertwined with code owned by AT&T.\n",
      "In 1975, Ken Thompson took a sabbatical from Bell Labs and came to Berkeley as a visiting professor. He helped to install Version 6 Unix and started working on a Pascal implementation for the system. Graduate students Chuck Haley and Bill Joy improved Thompson's Pascal and implemented an improved text editor, ex.[10] Other universities became interested in the software at Berkeley, and so in 1977 Joy started compiling the first Berkeley Software Distribution (1BSD), which was released on March 9, 1978.[11] 1BSD was an add-on to Version 6 Unix rather than a complete operating system in its own right. Some thirty copies were sent out.[10]\n",
      "The second Berkeley Software Distribution (2BSD), released in May 1979,[12] included updated versions of the 1BSD software as well as two new programs by Joy that persist on Unix systems to this day: the vi text editor (a visual version of ex) and the C shell. Some 75 copies of 2BSD were sent out by Bill Joy.[10]\n",
      "The VAX-11/780, a typical minicomputer used for early BSD timesharing systems\n",
      "A VAX computer was installed at Berkeley in 1978, but the port of Unix to the VAX architecture, UNIX/32V, did not take advantage of the VAX's virtual memory capabilities. The kernel of 32V was largely rewritten to include Berkeley graduate student Özalp Babaoğlu's virtual memory implementation, and a complete operating system including the new kernel, ports of the 2BSD utilities to the VAX, and the utilities from 32V was released as 3BSD at the end of 1979. 3BSD was also alternatively called Virtual VAX/UNIX or VMUNIX (for Virtual Memory Unix), and BSD kernel images were normally called /vmunix until 4.4BSD.\n",
      "\"4.3 BSD UNIX\" from the University of Wisconsin c. 1987. System startup and login.\n",
      "After 4.3BSD was released in June 1986, it was determined that BSD would move away from the aging VAX platform. The Power 6/32 platform (codenamed \"Tahoe\") developed by Computer Consoles Inc. seemed promising at the time, but was abandoned by its developers shortly thereafter. Nonetheless, the 4.3BSD-Tahoe port (June 1988) proved valuable, as it led to a separation of machine-dependent and machine-independent code in BSD which would improve the system's future portability.\n",
      "In addition to portability, the CSRG worked on an implementation of the OSI network protocol stack, improvements to the kernel virtual memory system and (with Van Jacobson of LBL) new TCP/IP algorithms to accommodate the growth of the Internet.[13]\n",
      "Until then, all versions of BSD used proprietary AT&T Unix code, and were therefore subject to an AT&T software license. Source code licenses had become very expensive and several outside parties had expressed interest in a separate release of the networking code, which had been developed entirely outside AT&T and would not be subject to the licensing requirement. This led to Networking Release 1 (Net/1), which was made available to non-licensees of AT&T code and was freely redistributable under the terms of the BSD license. It was released in June 1989.\n",
      "After Net/1, BSD developer Keith Bostic proposed that more non-AT&T sections of the BSD system be released under the same license as Net/1. To this end, he started a project to reimplement most of the standard Unix utilities without using the AT&T code. Within eighteen months, all of the AT&T utilities had been replaced, and it was determined that only a few AT&T files remained in the kernel. These files were removed, and the result was the June 1991 release of Networking Release 2 (Net/2), a nearly complete operating system that was freely distributable.\n",
      "Net/2 was the basis for two separate ports of BSD to the Intel 80386 architecture: the free 386BSD by William and Lynne Jolitz, and the proprietary BSD/386 (later renamed BSD/OS) by Berkeley Software Design (BSDi). 386BSD itself was short-lived, but became the initial code base of the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects that were started shortly thereafter.\n",
      "BSDi soon found itself in legal trouble with AT&T's Unix System Laboratories (USL) subsidiary, then the owners of the System V copyright and the Unix trademark. The USL v. BSDi lawsuit was filed in 1992 and led to an injunction on the distribution of Net/2 until the validity of USL's copyright claims on the source could be determined. The lawsuit slowed development of the free-software descendants of BSD for nearly two years while their legal status was in question, and as a result systems based on the Linux kernel, which did not have such legal ambiguity, gained greater support. The lawsuit was settled in January 1994, largely in Berkeley's favor. Of the 18,000 files in the Berkeley distribution, only three had to be removed and 70 modified to show USL copyright notices. A further condition of the settlement was that USL would not file further lawsuits against users and distributors of the Berkeley-owned code in the upcoming 4.4BSD release.[14]\n",
      "The final release from Berkeley was 1995's 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2, after which the CSRG was dissolved and development of BSD at Berkeley ceased. Since then, several variants based directly or indirectly on 4.4BSD-Lite (such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD) have been maintained.\n",
      "The permissive nature of the BSD license has allowed many other operating systems, both open-source and proprietary, to incorporate BSD source code. For example, Microsoft Windows used BSD code in its implementation of TCP/IP[15] and bundles recompiled versions of BSD's command-line networking tools since Windows 2000.[16] Darwin, the basis for Apple's macOS and iOS, is based on 4.4BSD-Lite2 and FreeBSD. Various commercial Unix operating systems, such as Solaris, also incorporate BSD code.\n",
      "Relationship to Research Unix[edit]\n",
      "Starting with the 8th Edition, versions of Research Unix at Bell Labs had a close relationship to BSD. This began when 4.1cBSD for the VAX was used as the basis for Research Unix 8th Edition. This continued in subsequent versions, such as the 9th Edition, which incorporated source code and improvements from 4.3BSD. The result was that these later versions of Research Unix were closer to BSD than they were to System V. In a Usenet posting from 2000, Dennis Ritchie described this relationship between BSD and Research Unix:[17][better source needed]\n",
      "Research Unix 8th Edition started from (I think) BSD 4.1c, but with enormous amounts scooped out and replaced by our own stuff. This continued with 9th and 10th. The ordinary user command-set was, I guess, a bit more BSD-flavored than SysVish, but it was pretty eclectic.\n",
      "Relationship to System V[edit]\n",
      "Eric S. Raymond summarizes the longstanding relationship between System V and BSD, stating, \"The divide was roughly between longhairs and shorthairs; programmers and technical people tended to line up with Berkeley and BSD, more business-oriented types with AT&T and System V.\"[18]\n",
      "In 1989, David A. Curry wrote about the differences between BSD and System V. He characterized System V as being often regarded as the \"standard Unix.\" However, he described BSD as more popular among university and government computer centers, due to its advanced features and performance:[19]\n",
      "Most university and government computer centers that use UNIX use Berkeley UNIX, rather than System V. There are several reasons for this, but perhaps the two most significant are that Berkeley UNIX provides networking capabilities that until recently (Release 3.0) were completely unavailable in System V, and that Berkeley UNIX is much more suited to a research environment, which requires a faster file system, better virtual memory handling, and a larger variety of programming languages.\n",
      "Technology[edit]\n",
      "Berkeley sockets[edit]\n",
      "4.3 BSD from the University of Wisconsin. Displaying the man page for Franz Lisp.\n",
      "Tape for SunOS 4.1.1, a 4.3BSD derivative\n",
      "Sony NEWS workstation running the BSD-based NEWS-OS operating system\n",
      "Berkeley's Unix was the first Unix to include libraries supporting the Internet Protocol stacks: Berkeley sockets. A Unix implementation of IP's predecessor, the ARPAnet's NCP, with FTP and Telnet clients, had been produced at the University of Illinois in 1975, and was available at Berkeley.[20][21] However, the memory scarcity on the PDP-11 forced a complicated design and performance problems.[22]\n",
      "By integrating sockets with the Unix operating system's file descriptors, it became almost as easy to read and write data across a network as it was to access a disk. The AT&T laboratory eventually released their own STREAMS library, which incorporated much of the same functionality in a software stack with a different architecture, but the wide distribution of the existing sockets library reduced the impact of the new API. Early versions of BSD were used to form Sun Microsystems' SunOS, founding the first wave of popular Unix workstations.\n",
      "Binary compatibility[edit]\n",
      "Some BSD operating systems can run native software of several other operating systems on the same architecture, using a binary compatibility layer. This is much simpler and faster than emulation; for example, it allows applications intended for Linux to be run at effectively full speed. This makes BSDs not only suitable for server environments, but also for workstation ones, given the increasing availability of commercial or closed-source software for Linux only. This also allows administrators to migrate legacy commercial applications, which may have only supported commercial Unix variants, to a more modern operating system, retaining the functionality of such applications until they can be replaced by a better alternative.\n",
      "Standards[edit]\n",
      "Current BSD operating system variants support many of the common IEEE, ANSI, ISO, and POSIX standards, while retaining most of the traditional BSD behavior. Like AT&T Unix, the BSD kernel is monolithic, meaning that device drivers in the kernel run in privileged mode, as part of the core of the operating system.\n",
      "BSD descendants[edit]\n",
      "See also: Comparison of BSD operating systems\n",
      "Several operating systems are based on BSD, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MidnightBSD, MirOS BSD, GhostBSD, Darwin and DragonFly BSD. Both NetBSD and FreeBSD were created in 1993.

Influenced NetBSD FreeBSD OpenBSD DragonFly BSD NeXTSTEP Darwin Influenced by Unix Default user interface Unix shell License BSD The Berkeley Software Distribution or Berkeley Standard Distribution1 BSD is a discontinued operating system based on Research Unix developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group CSRG at the University of California Berkeley Since the original has become obsolete the term BSD is commonly used for its opensource descendants including FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD and DragonFly BSD BSD was initially called Berkeley Unix because it was based on the source code of the original Unix developed at Bell Labs In the 1980s BSD was widely adopted by workstation vendors in the form of proprietary Unix variants such as DEC Ultrix and Sun Microsystems SunOS due to its permissive licensing and familiarity to many technology company founders and engineers These proprietary BSD derivatives were largely superseded in the 1990s by UNIX SVR4 and OSF1 Later releases of BSD provided the basis for several opensource operating systems including FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD DragonFly BSD Darwin and TrueOS These in turn have been used by proprietary operating systems including Apples macOS and iOS which derived from them2 and Microsoft Windows since at least 2000 and XP which used at least part of its TCPIP code which was legal3better source needed Code from FreeBSD was also used to create the operating systems for the PlayStation 54 PlayStation 45 PlayStation 36 PlayStation Vita7 and Nintendo Switch89 edit Main article of the Berkeley Software Distribution Simplified evolution of Unix systems Not shown are Junos PlayStation 3 system software and other proprietary forks The earliest distributions of Unix from Bell Labs in the 1970s included the source code to the operating system allowing researchers at universities to modify and extend Unix The operating system arrived at Berkeley in 1974 at the request of computer science professor Bob Fabry who had been on the program committee for the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles where Unix was first presented A PDP1145 was bought to run the system but for budgetary reasons this machine was shared with the mathematics and statistics groups at Berkeley who used RSTS so that Unix only ran on the machine eight hours per day sometimes during the day sometimes during the night A larger PDP1170 was installed at Berkeley the following year using money from the Ingres database project10 BSD began life as a variant of Unix that programmers at the University of California at Berkeley initially led by Bill Joy began developing in the late 1970s It included extra features which were intertwined with code owned by ATT In 1975 Ken Thompson took a sabbatical from Bell Labs and came to Berkeley as a visiting professor He helped to install Version 6 Unix and started working on a Pascal implementation for the system Graduate students Chuck Haley and Bill Joy improved Thompsons Pascal and implemented an improved text editor ex10 Other universities became interested in the software at Berkeley and so in 1977 Joy started compiling the first Berkeley Software Distribution 1BSD which was released on March 9 197811 1BSD was an addon to Version 6 Unix rather than a complete operating system in its own right Some thirty copies were sent out10 The second Berkeley Software Distribution 2BSD released in May 197912 included updated versions of the 1BSD software as well as two new programs by Joy that persist on Unix systems to this day the vi text editor a visual version of ex and the C shell Some 75 copies of 2BSD were sent out by Bill Joy10 The VAX11780 a typical minicomputer used for early BSD timesharing systems A VAX computer was installed at Berkeley in 1978 but the port of Unix to the VAX architecture UNIX32V did not take advantage of the VAXs virtual memory capabilities The kernel of 32V was largely rewritten to include Berkeley graduate student Özalp Babaoğlus virtual memory implementation and a complete operating system including the new kernel ports of the 2BSD utilities to the VAX and the utilities from 32V was released as 3BSD at the end of 1979 3BSD was also alternatively called Virtual VAXUNIX or VMUNIX for Virtual Memory Unix and BSD kernel images were normally called vmunix until 44BSD 43 BSD UNIX from the University of Wisconsin c 1987 System startup and login After 43BSD was released in June 1986 it was determined that BSD would move away from the aging VAX platform The Power 632 platform codenamed Tahoe developed by Computer Consoles Inc seemed promising at the time but was abandoned by its developers shortly thereafter Nonetheless the 43BSDTahoe port June 1988 proved valuable as it led to a separation of machinedependent and machineindependent code in BSD which would improve the systems future portability In addition to portability the CSRG worked on an implementation of the OSI network protocol stack improvements to the kernel virtual memory system and with Van Jacobson of LBL new TCPIP algorithms to accommodate the growth of the Internet13 Until then all versions of BSD used proprietary ATT Unix code and were therefore subject to an ATT software license Source code licenses had become very expensive and several outside parties had expressed interest in a separate release of the networking code which had been developed entirely outside ATT and would not be subject to the licensing requirement This led to Networking Release 1 Net1 which was made available to nonlicensees of ATT code and was freely redistributable under the terms of the BSD license It was released in June 1989 After Net1 BSD developer Keith Bostic proposed that more nonATT sections of the BSD system be released under the same license as Net1 To this end he started a project to reimplement most of the standard Unix utilities without using the ATT code Within eighteen months all of the ATT utilities had been replaced and it was determined that only a few ATT files remained in the kernel These files were removed and the result was the June 1991 release of Networking Release 2 Net2 a nearly complete operating system that was freely distributable Net2 was the basis for two separate ports of BSD to the Intel 80386 architecture the free 386BSD by William and Lynne Jolitz and the proprietary BSD386 later renamed BSDOS by Berkeley Software Design BSDi 386BSD itself was shortlived but became the initial code base of the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects that were started shortly thereafter BSDi soon found itself in legal trouble with ATTs Unix System Laboratories USL subsidiary then the owners of the System V copyright and the Unix trademark The USL v BSDi lawsuit was filed in 1992 and led to an injunction on the distribution of Net2 until the validity of USLs copyright claims on the source could be determined The lawsuit slowed development of the freesoftware descendants of BSD for nearly two years while their legal status was in question and as a result systems based on the Linux kernel which did not have such legal ambiguity gained greater support The lawsuit was settled in January 1994 largely in Berkeleys favor Of the 18000 files in the Berkeley distribution only three had to be removed and 70 modified to show USL copyright notices A further condition of the settlement was that USL would not file further lawsuits against users and distributors of the Berkeleyowned code in the upcoming 44BSD release14 The final release from Berkeley was 1995s 44BSDLite Release 2 after which the CSRG was dissolved and development of BSD at Berkeley ceased Since then several variants based directly or indirectly on 44BSDLite such as FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD have been maintained The permissive nature of the BSD license has allowed many other operating systems both opensource and proprietary to incorporate BSD source code For example Microsoft Windows used BSD code in its implementation of TCPIP15 and bundles recompiled versions of BSDs commandline networking tools since Windows 200016 Darwin the basis for Apples macOS and iOS is based on 44BSDLite2 and FreeBSD Various commercial Unix operating systems such as Solaris also incorporate BSD code Relationship to Research Unixedit Starting with the 8th Edition versions of Research Unix at Bell Labs had a close relationship to BSD This began when 41cBSD for the VAX was used as the basis for Research Unix 8th Edition This continued in subsequent versions such as the 9th Edition which incorporated source code and improvements from 43BSD The result was that these later versions of Research Unix were closer to BSD than they were to System V In a Usenet posting from 2000 Dennis Ritchie described this relationship between BSD and Research Unix17better source needed Research Unix 8th Edition started from I think BSD 41c but with enormous amounts scooped out and replaced by our own stuff This continued with 9th and 10th The ordinary user commandset was I guess a bit more BSDflavored than SysVish but it was pretty eclectic Relationship to System Vedit Eric S Raymond summarizes the longstanding relationship between System V and BSD stating The divide was roughly between longhairs and shorthairs programmers and technical people tended to line up with Berkeley and BSD more businessoriented types with ATT and System V18 In 1989 David A Curry wrote about the differences between BSD and System V He characterized System V as being often regarded as the standard Unix However he described BSD as more popular among university and government computer centers due to its advanced features and performance19 Most university and government computer centers that use UNIX use Berkeley UNIX rather than System V There are several reasons for this but perhaps the two most significant are that Berkeley UNIX provides networking capabilities that until recently Release 30 were completely unavailable in System V and that Berkeley UNIX is much more suited to a research environment which requires a faster file system better virtual memory handling and a larger variety of programming languages Technologyedit Berkeley socketsedit 43 BSD from the University of Wisconsin Displaying the man page for Franz Lisp Tape for SunOS 411 a 43BSD derivative Sony NEWS workstation running the BSDbased NEWSOS operating system Berkeleys Unix was the first Unix to include libraries supporting the Internet Protocol stacks Berkeley sockets A Unix implementation of IPs predecessor the ARPAnets NCP with FTP and Telnet clients had been produced at the University of Illinois in 1975 and was available at Berkeley2021 However the memory scarcity on the PDP11 forced a complicated design and performance problems22 By integrating sockets with the Unix operating systems file descriptors it became almost as easy to read and write data across a network as it was to access a disk The ATT laboratory eventually released their own STREAMS library which incorporated much of the same functionality in a software stack with a different architecture but the wide distribution of the existing sockets library reduced the impact of the new API Early versions of BSD were used to form Sun Microsystems SunOS founding the first wave of popular Unix workstations Binary compatibilityedit Some BSD operating systems can run native software of several other operating systems on the same architecture using a binary compatibility layer This is much simpler and faster than emulation for example it allows applications intended for Linux to be run at effectively full speed This makes BSDs not only suitable for server environments but also for workstation ones given the increasing availability of commercial or closedsource software for Linux only This also allows administrators to migrate legacy commercial applications which may have only supported commercial Unix variants to a more modern operating system retaining the functionality of such applications until they can be replaced by a better alternative Standardsedit Current BSD operating system variants support many of the common IEEE ANSI ISO and POSIX standards while retaining most of the traditional BSD behavior Like ATT Unix the BSD kernel is monolithic meaning that device drivers in the kernel run in privileged mode as part of the core of the operating system BSD descendantsedit See also Comparison of BSD operating systems Several operating systems are based on BSD including FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD

       "\"Dennis Ritchie bei der Verleihung des Japan-Preises 2011\\nKen Thompson (links) und Dennis Ritchie (rechts)\\nDennis MacAlistair Ritchie (* 9. September 1941 in Bronxville, New York; † vor dem 12. Oktober 2011 in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey) war ein US-amerikanischer Informatiker. Er entwickelte zusammen mit Ken Thompson und anderen die erste Version des Unix-Betriebssystems[1][2] und schrieb die ersten sechs Ausgaben des Unix Programmer’s Manual,[3] ehe das Handbuch in „Unix Time-Sharing System“ umbenannt wurde.[4]\\nZusammen mit Thompson und Brian W. Kernighan entwickelte er die Programmiersprache C.[5] Kernighan und Ritchie schrieben gemeinsam das Buch The C Programming Language, das oft mit dem Kürzel K&R zitiert wird. Bekannt und berühmt sind auch seine Initialen dmr, die Ritchie als Username für den System-Login verwendete. Für seine Arbeiten, insbesondere die Entwicklung des bis heute maßgeblichen Unix-Betriebssystems und der Sprache C, erhielt er einige der höchsten Auszeichnungen der Informatik wie etwa den Turing-Award.\\nInhaltsverzeichnis\\n1 Leben\\n2 Auszeichnungen\\n3 Werke\\n4 Weblinks\\n5 Einzelnachweise\\nLeben[Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten]\\nDennis Ritchie wurde am 9. September 1941 als Sohn von Alistair E. Ritchie geboren. Er studierte an der Universität Harvard Physik und Angewandte Mathematik. 1968 wurde ihm für seine Dissertation Program Structure and Computational Complexity der Doktorgrad (englisch Ph.D.) von der Universität Harvard verliehen.[6]\\nAb 1967 arbeitete Ritchie in den Bell Telephone Laboratories (kurz „Bell Labs“) im Computing Sciences Research Center. Er beschäftigte sich mit Multics, BCPL, ALTRAN und schließlich mit den Programmiersprachen B und C sowie den Betriebssystemen Unix und Plan 9. Zuletzt war er der Leiter der Forschungsabteilung für System-Software bei Lucent Technologies/Bell Labs.\\n2007 ging Ritchie in den Ruhestand und arbeitete fortan gelegentlich als Berater.[7]\\nRitchie wurde am 12. Oktober 2011 im Alter von 70 Jahren in seinem Haus in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, wo er zuvor allein gelebt hatte, tot aufgefunden. Erste Nachrichten über seinen Tod kamen von seinem ehemaligen Kollegen Rob Pike. Die Ursache und der genaue Zeitpunkt des Todes wurden nicht bekannt gegeben. Nach der Behandlung von Prostatakrebs und Herzerkrankungen war er mehrere Jahre gesundheitlich beeinträchtigt. Die Nachricht von Ritchies Tod wurde größtenteils von der Medienberichterstattung über den Tod von Apple-Mitbegründer Steve Jobs in der Woche zuvor überschattet.[8][9]\\nAuszeichnungen[Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten]\\nZusammen mit Ken Thompson erhielt er 1983 den Turing Award, 1990 die Richard-W.-Hamming-Medaille des IEEE, 1999 die National Medal of Technology. 2005 wurde Ritchie mit dem IRI Achievement Award des Industrial Research Institute ausgezeichnet.[10] 2011 bekam er den Japan-Preis für die Entwicklung von Unix und C.[11] 2019 wurde er posthum in die National Inventors Hall of Fame aufgenommen.\\nWerke[Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten]\\nBrian W.
