Doctoral students Krysta Svore Gaurav Kc Marc Eaddy Marcio Buss Alfred Vaino Aho born August 9 1941 is a Canadian computer scientist best known for his work on programming languages compilers and related algorithms and his textbooks on the art and science of computer programming234 Aho was elected into the National Academy of Engineering in 1999 for his contributions to the fields of algorithms and programming tools He and his longtime collaborator Jeffrey Ullman are the recipients of the 2020 Turing Award generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science5 Careeredit Aho received a BASc 1963 in Engineering Physics from the University of Toronto then an MA 1965 and PhD 1967 in Electrical EngineeringComputer Science from Princeton University6 He conducted research at Bell Labs from 1967 to 1991 and again from 1997 to 2002 as Vice President of the Computing Sciences Research Center7 Since 1995 he has held the Lawrence Gussman Professorship in Computer Science at Columbia University He served as chair of the department from 1995 to 1997 and again in the spring of 20038 In his PhD thesis Aho created indexed grammars9 and the nestedstack automaton10 as vehicles for extending the power of contextfree languages but retaining many of their decidability and closure properties One application of indexed grammars is modelling parallel rewriting systems11 particularly in biological applications12 After graduating from Princeton Aho joined the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs where he devised efficient regular expression and stringpattern matching algorithms that he implemented in the first versions of the Unix tools egrep and fgrep The fgrep algorithm has become known as the AhoCorasick algorithm it is used by several bibliographic searchsystems including the one developed by Margaret J Corasick and by other stringsearching applications13 At Bell Labs Aho worked closely with Steve Johnson and Jeffrey Ullman to develop efficient algorithms for analyzing and translating programming languages14 Steve Johnson used the bottomup LALR parsing algorithms to create the syntaxanalyzer generator yacc15 and Michael E Lesk and Eric Schmidt used Ahos regularexpression patternmatching algorithms to create the lexicalanalyzer generator lex16 The lex and yacc tools and their derivatives have been used to develop the front ends of many of todays programming language compilers17 Aho and Ullman wrote a series of textbooks on compiling techniques that codified the theory relevant to compiler design Their 1977 textbook Principles of Compiler Design had a green dragon on the front cover and became known as the green dragon book In 1986 Aho and Ullman were joined by Ravi Sethi to create a new edition the red dragon book which was briefly shown in the 1995 movie Hackers and in 2006 also by Monica Lam to create the purple dragon book The dragon books are used for university courses as well as industry references18 In 1974 Aho John Hopcroft and Ullman wrote The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms19 codifying some of their early research on algorithms This book became one of the most highly cited books in computer science for several decades and helped to stimulate the creation of algorithms and data structures as a central course in the computer science curriculum20 Aho is also widely known for his coauthorship of the AWK programming language with Peter J Weinberger and Brian Kernighan the A stands for Aho21 As of 2010 Ahos research interests include programming languages compilers algorithms and quantum computing He is part of the Language and Compilers researchgroup at Columbia University22 Overall his works have been cited 81040 times and he has an hindex of 66 as of May 8 201923 Aho has received many prestigious honors including the IEEEs John von Neumann Medal and membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 200324 He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Waterloo25 from the University of Helsinki25 and from the University of Toronto26 He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ACM Bell Labs and IEEE20 Aho has twice served as chair of the Advisory Committee for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation He is a past president of the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computability Theory27 Aho Hopcroft and Ullman were corecipients

Parallel computing Compilers Optimizing compilers Institutions IBM New York University Website wwwibmcomibmhistorywitexhibitwithallallenhtml Frances Elizabeth Allen August 4 1932  August 4 202023 was an American computer scientist and pioneer in the field of optimizing compilers456 Allen was the first woman to become an IBM Fellow and in 2006 became the first woman to win the Turing Award7 Her achievements include seminal work in compilers program optimization and parallelization8 She worked for IBM from 1957 to 2002 and subsequently was a Fellow Emerita9 Early life and educationedit Allen grew up on a farm in Peru New York near Lake Champlain as the oldest of six children Her father was a farmer and her mother an elementary schoolteacher9 Her early elementary education took place in a oneroom school house a mile away from her home and she later attended a local high school10 She graduated from The New York State College for Teachers now part of the University at Albany SUNY with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1954 and began teaching school in Peru New York10 After two years she enrolled at the University of Michigan and earned a Master of Science degree in mathematics in 195711 Career and researchedit Deeply in debt with student loans she joined IBM Research in Poughkeepsie New York as a programmer in 1957 where she taught incoming employees the basics of Fortran She planned to return to teaching once her student loans had been paid but ended up staying with IBM for her entire 45year career In 1959 Allen was assigned to the Harvest project for code breaking with the National Security Agency and worked on a programming language called Alpha7 She managed the compileroptimization team for both Harvest and the Stretch project In 1962 she was transferred to Thomas J Watson Research Center where she contributed to the ACS1 project and later in the 1970s to PLI During these years she worked with fellow researcher John Cocke to write a series of seminal papers on optimizing compilers helping to improve the efficiency of machine code translated from highlevel languages2 From 1970 to 1971 she spent a sabbatical at New York University and acted as adjunct professor for a few years afterward Another sabbatical brought her to Stanford University in 197711 From 1980 to 1995 Allen led IBMs work in the developing parallel computing area and helped to develop software for the IBM Blue Gene project12 Allen became the first female IBM Fellow in 1989 She retired from IBM in 2002 but remained affiliated with the corporation as a Fellow Emerita In 2007 the IBM PhD Fellowship Award was created in her honor13 After retiring she remained active in programs that encourage women and girls to seek careers in science and computing14 Her A M Turing Award citation reads Fran Allens work has had an enormous impact on compiler research and practice Both alone and in joint work with John Cocke she introduced many of the abstractions algorithms and implementations that laid the groundwork for automatic program optimization technology Allens 1966 paper Program Optimization laid the conceptual basis for systematic analysis and transformation of computer programs This paper introduced the use of graphtheoretic structures to encode program content in order to automatically and efficiently derive relationships and identify opportunities for optimization Her 1970 papers Control Flow Analysis and A Basis for Program Optimization established intervals as the context for efficient and effective data flow analysis and optimization Her 1971 paper with Cocke A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations provided the first description and systematization of optimizing transformations Her 1973 and 1974 papers on interprocedural data flow analysis extended the analysis to whole programs Her 1976 paper with Cocke describes one of the two main analysis strategies used in optimizing compilers today Allen developed and implemented her methods as part of compilers for the IBM STRETCHHARVEST and the experimental Advanced Computing System This work established the feasibility and structure of modern machine and languageindependent optimizers She went on to establish and lead the PTRAN project on the automatic parallel execution of FORTRAN programs Her PTRAN team developed new parallelism detection schemes and created the concept of the program dependence graph the primary structuring method used by most parallelizing compilers  Association for Computing Machinery ACM Citation for the A M Turing Award 2006 Awards and honorsedit Portrait of Fran Allen receiving the Erna Hamburger Distinguished Lecture Award at EPFL May 6 2008 Allen was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE and the Association for Computing Machinery ACM In 2000 she was made a Fellow of the Computer  Museum for her contributions to program optimization and compiling for parallel computers15 She was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 198716 to the American Philosophical Society in 200117 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 20101 She was nominated a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 199418 She received the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award in 1997 and the Computer Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computer Society in 200419 In 1997 Allen was inducted into the Witi Hall of Fame20 She won the 2002 Augusta Ada Lovelace Award from the Association for Women in Computing In 2004 Allen was the winner of the ABIE Award for Technical Leadership from the Anita Borg Institute2122 Allen was recognized for her work in highperformance computing with the 2006 Turing Award923 She became the first woman recipient in the fortyyear history of the award which is considered the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing and is given by the Association for Computing Machinery2414252627 In interviews following the award she hoped it would give more opportunities for women in science computing and engineering28 In 2009 she was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree from McGill University for pioneering contributions to the theory and practice of optimizing compiler techniques that laid the foundation for modern optimizing compilers and automatic parallel execution29 Publicationsedit A list of her

1941年9月9日ニューヨーク州ブロンクスビルに生まれる父親のアリステアEリッチーはベル研究所の研究者でスイッチング回路理論英語版に関する共著書 The Design of Switching Circuits がある子どものころ家族に連れられニュージャージー州サミット英語版に移りサミットの高校に進学した6 経歴編集 C言語およびUNIXも参照 ハーバード大学で物理学と応用数学の学位を得た後1967年ベル研究所の計算機科学研究センターに勤務を始めるその後1968年ハーバード大学でパトリックCフィッシャー英語版の指導により計算機科学の博士号を取得した博士論文のテーマは Program Structure and Computational Complexityプログラム構造と計算複雑性であった7 ケントンプソン左とデニスリッチー右 1969年ごろリッチーはケントンプソンと共にベル研究所で放置の状態にあったPDP7上で独自のオペレーティングシステムを作り始めるこれが後にUNIXと呼ばれるOSの原型となったUNIXは1969年に原型が出来上がり1971年に PDP1120 に移植されたこのUNIX上で動作するアプリケーションを作るためにトンプソンによってB言語が開発されリッチーがこれにデータ型と新しい文法等を追加しC言語が出来上がった当初はアプリケーションを作成するために作られたC言語であったが 1973年にそれまでアセンブリ言語で書かれていたUNIXをC言語で書き換えることに応用され実際に移植は成功したこの頃のUNIXは文書マシンとして使われており主にベル研究所の特許事務に用いられていた 当初はPDP11のアーキテクチャーに依存する側面が大きかったUNIXとC言語であったが徐々にPDP11への依存性を減少させていき1978年にDEC製以外のコンピュータへのUNIXの移植に成功した C言語の開発はリッチーのUNIXへの最大の貢献のうちの一つである8 1983年UNIX開発の功績によりケントンプソンと共にチューリング賞を受賞している21世紀初頭現在でさえC言語は組み込みシステムからスーパーコンピュータまであらゆるタイプのプラットフォーム上で用いられており彼の業績は非常に大きい 晩年は引き続きベル研究所にて1995年に発表されたオープンソース版の分散システム用オペレーティングシステムであるPlan 9や1996年に公表された分散システム用オペレーティングシステムの Inferno とその言語 Limbo の開発に携わった 受賞歴編集 日本国際賞を受賞するリッチー右2011年ニュージャージー州マレーヒル英語版のベル研究所本部にて

scientist2 Careeredit Jerry Saltzer received an ScD in Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1966 His dissertation Traffic Control in a Multiplexed System was advised by Fernando Corbató3 In 1966 he joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT One of Saltzers earliest involvements with computers was with MITs Compatible TimeSharing System in the early 1960s In the later 1960s and early 1970s he was one of the team leaders of the Multics operating system project Multics though not particularly commercially successful in itself has had a major impact on all subsequent operating systems in particular it was an inspiration for Ken Thompson to develop Unix Saltzers contributions to Multics included the nowstandard kernel stack switching method of process switching as well as oftcited work on the security architecture for shared information systems4 Saltzer led the Computer Systems Research group of MITs Laboratory for Computer Science In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Computer Systems Research group was one of the key players in the development of the Internet and ring network technology for local area networks During this time Saltzer patented the Proteon ProNet ring network He is the coauthor of The Protection of Information in Computer Systems From 1984 to 1988 Saltzer served as Technical Director of MITs Project Athena Saltzermitedu is one of the few Athena usernames with a capital letter and legend has it that several special case hacks were required to support this functionality In September 1995 Saltzer retired from his fulltime faculty position but continued writing and teaching parttime at MIT2 Familyedit Saltzer is known to all colleagues students friends and family as Jerry In 1961 he married Marlys Anne

MusgraveMurad Taqqu Benoit B Mandelbrotab 20 November 1924  14 October 2010 was a Polishborn FrenchAmerican mathematician and polymath with broad interests in the practical sciences especially regarding what he labeled as the art of roughness of physical phenomena and the uncontrolled element in life678 He referred to himself as a fractalist9 and is recognized for his contribution to the field of fractal geometry which included coining the word fractal as well as developing a theory of roughness and selfsimilarity in nature10 In 1936 at the age of 11 Mandelbrot and his family emigrated from Warsaw Poland to France After World War II ended Mandelbrot studied mathematics graduating from universities in Paris and in the United States and receiving a masters degree in aeronautics from the California Institute of Technology He spent most of his career in both the United States and France having dual French and American citizenship In 1958 he began a 35year career at IBM where he became an IBM Fellow and periodically took leaves of absence to teach at Harvard University At Harvard following the publication of his study of US commodity markets in relation to cotton futures he taught economics and applied sciences Because of his access to IBMs computers Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images leading to his discovery of the Mandelbrot set in 1980 He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules He said that things typically considered to be rough a mess or chaotic such as clouds or shorelines actually had a degree of order11 His math and geometrycentered research included contributions to such fields as statistical physics meteorology hydrology geomorphology anatomy taxonomy neurology linguistics information technology computer graphics economics geology medicine physical cosmology engineering chaos theory econophysics metallurgy and the social sciences12 Toward the end of his career he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Yale University where he was the oldest professor in Yales history to receive tenure13 Mandelbrot also held positions at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Université Lille Nord de France Institute for Advanced Study and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique During his career he received over 15 honorary doctorates and served on many science journals along with winning numerous awards His autobiography The Fractalist Memoir of a Scientific Maverick was published posthumously in 2012 Early yearsedit External videos Family background and early education 411 Benoit Mandelbrot interview Part 1 of 144 Web of Stories14 Benedykt Mandelbrot15 was born in a Lithuanian Jewish family in Warsaw during the Second Polish Republic16 His father made his living trading clothing his mother was a dental surgeon During his first two school years he was tutored privately by an uncle who despised rote learning Most of my time was spent playing chess reading maps and learning how to open my eyes to everything around me17 In 1936 when he was 11 the family emigrated from Poland to France The move World War II and the influence of his fathers brother the mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt who had moved to Paris around 1920 further prevented a standard education The fact that my parents as economic and political refugees joined Szolem in France saved our lives he writes9 17 18 Mandelbrot attended the Lycée Rollin now the Collègelycée JacquesDecour in Paris until the start of World War II when his family moved to Tulle France He was helped by Rabbi David Feuerwerker the Rabbi of BrivelaGaillarde to continue his studies9 6263 19 Much of France was occupied by the Nazis at the time and Mandelbrot recalls this period Our constant fear was that a sufficiently determined foe might report us to an authority and we would be sent to our deaths This happened to a close friend from Paris Zina Morhange a physician in a nearby county seat Simply to eliminate the competition another physician denounced her  We escaped this fate Who knows why9 49 In 1944 Mandelbrot returned to Paris studied at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon and in 1945 to 1947 attended the École Polytechnique where he studied under Gaston Julia and Paul Lévy From 1947 to 1949 he studied at California Institute of Technology where he earned a masters degree in aeronautics2 Returning to France he obtained his PhD degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Paris in 195217 Research careeredit From 1949 to 1958 Mandelbrot was a staff member at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique During this time he spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton New Jersey where he was sponsored by John von Neumann In 1955 he married Aliette Kagan and moved to Geneva Switzerland to collaborate with Jean Piaget at the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology and later to the Université Lille Nord de France20 In 1958 the couple moved to the United States where Mandelbrot joined the research staff at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights New York20 He remained at IBM for 35 years becoming an IBM Fellow and later Fellow Emeritus17 From 1951 onward Mandelbrot worked on problems and published papers not only in mathematics but in applied fields such as information theory economics and fluid dynamics Randomness and fractals in financial marketsedit Mandelbrot saw financial markets as an example of wild randomness characterized by concentration and longrange dependence He developed several original approaches for modelling financial fluctuations21 In his early work he found that the price changes in financial markets did not follow a Gaussian distribution but rather Lévy stable distributions having infinite variance He found for example that cotton prices followed a Lévy stable distribution with parameter α equal to 17 rather than 2 as in a Gaussian distribution Stable distributions have the property that the sum of many instances of a random variable follows the same distribution but with a larger scale parameter22 The latter work from the early 60s was done with daily data of cotton prices from 1900 long before he introduced the word fractal In later years after the concept of fractals had matured the study of financial markets in the context of fractals became possible only after the availability of high frequency data in finance In the late 1980s Mandelbrot used intradaily tick data supplied by Olsen  Associates in Zurich2324 to apply fractal theory to market microstructure This cooperation led to the publication of the first comprehensive papers on scaling law in finance2526 This law shows similar properties at different time scales confirming Mandelbrots insight of the fractal nature of market microstructure Mandelbrots own research in this area is presented in his books Fractals and Scaling in Finance27 and The Misbehavior of Markets28 Developing fractal geometry and the Mandelbrot setedit As a visiting professor at Harvard University Mandelbrot began to study mathematical objects called Julia sets that were invariant under certain transformations of the complex plane Building on previous work by Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets While investigating the topology of these Julia sets he studied the Mandelbrot set which was introduced by him in 1979 Mandelbrot speaking about the Mandelbrot set during his acceptance speech for the Légion dhonneur in 2006 In 1975 Mandelbrot coined the term fractal to describe these structures and first published his ideas in the French book Les Objets Fractals Forme Hasard et Dimension later translated in 1977 as Fractals Form Chance and Dimension29 According to computer scientist and physicist Stephen Wolfram the book was a breakthrough for Mandelbrot who until then would typically apply fairly straightforward mathematics  to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before11 Wolfram adds that as a result of this new research he was no longer a wandering scientist and later called him the father of fractals Mandelbrot ended up doing a great piece of science and identifying a much stronger and more fundamental ideaput simply that there are some geometric shapes which he called fractals that are equally rough at all scales No matter how close you look they never get simpler much as the section of a rocky coastline you can see at your feet looks just as jagged as the stretch you can see from space11 Wolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole Fern leaves and Romanesque broccoli are two examples from nature11 He points out an unexpected conclusion One might have thought that such a simple and fundamental form of regularity would have been studied for hundreds if not thousands of years But it was not In fact it rose to prominence only over the past 30 or so yearsalmost entirely through the efforts of one man the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot11 Mandelbrot used the term fractal as it derived from the Latin word fractus defined as broken or shattered glass Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphics computer code images that an interviewer described as looking like the delirious exuberance of the 1960s psychedelic art with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body He also saw himself as a wouldbe Kepler after the 17thcentury scientist Johannes Kepler who calculated and described the orbits of the planets30 A Mandelbrot set Mandelbrot however never felt he was inventing a new idea He described his feelings in a documentary with science writer Arthur C Clarke Exploring this set I certainly never had the feeling of invention I never had the feeling that my imagination was rich enough to invent all those extraordinary things on discovering them They were there even though nobody had seen them before Its marvelous a very simple formula explains all these very complicated things So the goal of science is starting with a mess and explaining it with a simple formula a kind of dream of science31 According to Clarke the Mandelbrot set is indeed one of the most astonishing discoveries in the entire history of mathematics Who could have dreamed that such an incredibly simple equation could have generated images of literally infinite complexity Clarke also notes an odd coincidence the name Mandelbrot and the word mandalafor a religious symbolwhich Im sure is a pure coincidence but indeed the Mandelbrot set does seem to contain an enormous number of mandalas31 In 1982 Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in The Fractal Geometry of Nature32 This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics as well as silencing critics who had dismissed fractals as program artifacts Mandelbrot left IBM in 1987 after 35 years and 12 days when IBM decided to end pure research in his division33 He joined the Department of Mathematics at Yale and obtained his first tenured post in 1999 at the age of 7534 At the time of his retirement in 2005 he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences Fractals and the theory of roughnessedit Mandelbrot created the firstever theory of roughness and he saw roughness in the shapes of mountains coastlines and river basins the structures of plants blood vessels and lungs the clustering of galaxies His personal quest was to create some mathematical formula to measure the overall roughness of such objects in nature9 xi He began by asking himself various kinds of questions related to nature Can geometry deliver what the Greek root of its name geo seemed to promisetruthful measurement not only of cultivated fields along the Nile River but also of untamed Earth9 xii In his paper How Long Is the Coast of Britain Statistical SelfSimilarity and Fractional Dimension published in Science in 1967 Mandelbrot discusses selfsimilar curves that have Hausdorff dimension that are examples of fractals although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper as he did not coin it until 1975 The paper is one of Mandelbrots first publications on the topic of fractals3536 Mandelbrot emphasized the use of fractals as realistic and useful models for describing many rough phenomena in the real world He concluded that real roughness is often fractal and can be measured9 296 Although Mandelbrot coined the term fractal some of the mathematical objects he presented in The Fractal Geometry of Nature had been previously described by other mathematicians Before Mandelbrot however they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and nonintuitive properties Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the longstalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining nonsmooth rough objects in the real world His methods of research were both old and new The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest most concrete and most inclusive specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and today also by the computer  bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling  and unwittingly as a bonus for the purpose of creating beauty9 292 Fractals are also found in human pursuits such as music painting architecture and in the financial field Mandelbrot believed that fractals far from being unnatural were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional Euclidean geometry Clouds are not spheres mountains are not cones coastlines are not circles and bark is not smooth nor does lightning travel in a straight line Mandelbrot in his introduction to The Fractal Geometry of Nature Section of a Mandelbrot set Mandelbrot has been called an artist and a visionary37 and a maverick38 His informal and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations made The Fractal Geometry of Nature accessible to nonspecialists The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics Mandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology He offered in 1974 a new explanation of Olbers paradox the dark night sky riddle demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a sufficient but not necessary resolution of the paradox He postulated that if the stars in the universe were fractally distributed for example like Cantor dust it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bang theory to explain the paradox His model would not rule out a Big Bang but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred39 Awards and honorsedit Mandelbrots awards include the Wolf Prize for Physics in 1993 the Lewis Fry Richardson Prize of the European Geophysical Society in 2000 the Japan Prize in 200340 and the Einstein Lectureship of the American Mathematical Society in 2006 The small asteroid 27500 Mandelbrot was named in his honor In November

in Cambridge Massachusetts on 14 October 2010150 Reacting to news of his death mathematician HeinzOtto Peitgen said If we talk about impact inside mathematics and applications in the sciences he is one of the most important figures of the last fifty years1 Chris Anderson TED conference curator described Mandelbrot as an icon who changed how we see the world51 Nicolas Sarkozy President of France at the time of Mandelbrots death said Mandelbrot had a powerful original mind that never shied away from innovating and shattering preconceived notions  his work developed entirely outside mainstream research led to modern information theory52 Mandelbrots obituary in The Economist points out his fame as celebrity beyond the academy and lauds him as the father of fractal geometry53 Bestselling essayistauthor Nassim Nicholas Taleb has remarked that Mandelbrots book The MisBehavior of Markets is in his opinion The deepest and most realistic finance book ever published10 Bibliographyedit In

Operating system Microsoft Windows MSDOS Successor Turbo C Borland C Type IDE License Proprietary software Installation disk of Turbo C 15 Turbo C is a discontinued integrated development environment IDE and compiler for the C programming language from Borland First introduced in 1987 it was noted for its integrated development environment small size fast compile speed comprehensive manuals and low price In May 1990 Borland replaced Turbo C with Turbo C In 2006 Borland reintroduced the Turbo moniker Early historyedit In the early 1980s Borland enjoyed considerable success with their Turbo Pascal product and it became a popular choice when developing applications for the PC Borland followed up that success by releasing Turbo Prolog in 1986 and in 1987 Turbo Basic and Turbo C Turbo C has similar properties to Turbo Pascal an integrated development environment a fast compiler though not near the speed of Turbo Pascal1 a good editor and a competitive price Turbo C competed with other professional programming tools such as Microsoft C Watcom C2 and Lattice C while Turbo Pascal was successful with hobbyists and schools as well as professional programmers Version historyedit Version 10 May 13 1987 offered the first integrated development environment for C on IBM PCs Like many Borland products of the time the software was bought from another company in this case Wizard C compiler by Bob Jervis3 and branded with the Turbo name It ran in 384 kB of memory It allowed inline assembly with full access to C symbolic names and structures supported all memory models and offered optimizations for speed size constant folding and jump elimination4 Version 15 January 1988 was an incremental improvement over version 10 It included more sample programs improved manuals and bug fixes It was shipped on five 360 KB diskettes of uncompressed files and came with sample C programs including a stripped down spreadsheet called mcalc This version introduced the conioh header file which provided fast PCspecific console IO routines Version 20 late 1988 featured the first blue screen version which would be typical of all future Borland releases for MSDOS It was also available bundled with Turbo Assembler and Turbo Debugger Turbo C 20 was also released in Germany only for the Atari ST the program was not maintained by Borland but sold and renamed PureC This version introduced the graphicsh header file which provided the Borland Graphics Interface already included in Turbo Pascal With the release of Turbo C 10 in 1990 the two products were folded into one and the name Turbo C was discontinued The C compiler was developed under contract by a company in San Diego and was one of the first true compilers for C until then it was common to use precompilers that generated C code ref Cfront Freeware releaseedit In 2006citation needed Borlands successor Embarcadero Technologies rereleased Turbo C and the MSDOS versions of the Turbo C compilers as freeware567 Receptionedit BYTE in January 1989 listed Turbo C and Turbo Pascal as among the Distinction winners of the BYTE Awards Citing their user interface and continued emphasis on speed the magazine stated that for rapid prototyping theres not much better8 In a February 1989 overview of optimizing C compilers BYTE said that Turbo C Professional 20 is no exception to the companys welldeserved reputation for pricing good software The magazine reported that Turbo C compiles fastermuch fasterthan any other compiler we reviewed and praised the addition of Turbo Debugger the best source debugger BYTE concluded that Turbo C did not produce the fastest or smallest executable but its definitely the one that is most fun to use2 See alsoedit Turbo Assembler Turbo Debugger Referencesedit  Hague James A

Some Problems in the Boundary Value Theory of Linear Differential Equations 1942 Doctoral advisor Waldemar Trjitzinsky Richard Wesley Hamming February 11 1915  January 7 1998 was an American mathematician whose work had many implications for computer engineering and telecommunications His contributions include the Hamming code which makes use of a Hamming matrix the Hamming window Hamming numbers spherepacking or Hamming bound Hamming graph concepts and the Hamming distance Born in Chicago Hamming attended University of Chicago University of Nebraska and the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign where he wrote his doctoral thesis in mathematics under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky 19011973 In April 1945 he joined the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory where he programmed the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the projects physicists He left to join the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1946 Over the next fifteen years he was involved in nearly all of the laboratories most prominent achievements For his work he received the Turing Award in 1968 being its third recipient1 After retiring from the Bell Labs in 1976 Hamming took a position at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey California where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science and devoted himself to teaching and writing books He delivered his last lecture in December 1997 just a few weeks before he died from a heart attack on January 7 1998 Early lifeedit Hamming was born in Chicago Illinois on February 11 19152 the son of Richard J Hamming a credit manager and Mabel G Redfield3 His father was Dutch and his mother was a Mayflower descendant4 He grew up in Chicago where he attended Crane Technical High School and Crane Junior College3 Hamming initially wanted to study engineering but money was scarce during the Great Depression and the only scholarship offer he received came from the University of Chicago which had no engineering school Instead he became a science student majoring in mathematics5 and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 19372 He later considered this a fortunate turn of events As an engineer he said I would have been the guy going down manholes instead of having the excitement of frontier research work2 He went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1939 and then entered the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign where he wrote his doctoral thesis on Some Problems in the Boundary Value Theory of Linear Differential Equations under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky5 His thesis was an extension of Trjitzinskys work in that area He looked at Greens function and further developed Jacob Tamarkins methods for obtaining characteristic solutions6 While he was a graduate student he discovered and read George Booles The Laws of Thought7 The University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign awarded Hamming his Doctor of Philosophy in 1942 and he became an instructor in mathematics there He married Wanda Little a fellow student on September 5 19425 immediately after she was awarded her own Master of Arts in English literature They would remain married until his death and had no children3 In 1944 he became an assistant professor at the JB Speed Scientific School at the University of Louisville in Louisville Kentucky5 Manhattan Projectedit With World War II still ongoing Hamming left Louisville in April 1945 to work on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory in Hans Bethes division programming the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the projects physicists His wife Wanda soon followed taking a job at Los Alamos as a human computer working for Bethe and Edward Teller5 Hamming later recalled that Shortly before the first field test you realize that no small scale experiment can be doneeither you have a critical mass or you do not a man asked me to check some arithmetic he had done and I agreed thinking to fob it off on some subordinate When I asked what it was he said It is the probability that the test bomb will ignite the whole atmosphere I decided I would check it myself The next day when he came for the answers I remarked to him The arithmetic was apparently correct but I do not know about the formulas for the capture cross sections for oxygen and nitrogenafter all there could be no experiments at the needed energy levels He replied like a physicist talking to a mathematician that he wanted me to check the arithmetic not the physics and left I said to myself What have you done Hamming you are involved in risking all of life that is known in the Universe and you do not know much of an essential part I was pacing up and down the corridor when a friend asked me what was bothering me I told him His reply was Never mind Hamming no one will ever blame you7 Hamming remained at Los Alamos until 1946 when he accepted a post at the Bell Telephone Laboratories BTL For the trip to New Jersey he bought Klaus Fuchss old car When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming3 Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a computer janitor8 he saw computer simulations of experiments that would have been impossible to perform in a laboratory And when I had time to think about it he later recalled I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed2 Bell Laboratoriesedit A twodimensional visualisation of the Hamming distance The color of each pixel indicates the Hamming distance between the binary representations of its x and y coordinates modulo 16 in the 16color system At the Bell Labs Hamming shared an office for a time with Claude Shannon The Mathematical Research Department also included John Tukey and Los Alamos veterans Donald Ling and Brockway McMillan Shannon Ling McMillan and Hamming came to call themselves the Young Turks5 We were firstclass troublemakers Hamming later recalled We did unconventional things in unconventional ways and still got valuable results Thus management had to tolerate us and let us alone a lot of the time2 Although Hamming had been hired to work on elasticity theory he still spent much of his time with the calculating machines8 Before he went home on one Friday in 1947 he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off9 Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones units of information that Tukey would christen bits10 If a single bit in a sequence was wrong then the whole sequence would be To detect this a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence If the computer can tell when an error has occurred Hamming reasoned surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself9 Hamming set himself the task of solving this problem3 which he realised would have an enormous range of applications Each bit can only be a zero or a one so if you know which bit is wrong then it can be corrected In a landmark paper published in 1950 he introduced a concept of the number of positions in which two code words differ and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another which is today known as the Hamming distance11 Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical errorcorrecting codes which are called Hamming codes This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science it opened up a whole new field of study1112 The Hamming bound also known as the spherepacking or volume bound is a limit on the parameters of an arbitrary block code It is from an interpretation in terms of sphere packing in the Hamming distance into the space of all possible words It gives an important limitation on the efficiency with which any errorcorrecting code can utilize the space in which its code words are embedded A code which attains the Hamming bound is said to be a perfect code Hamming codes are perfect codes1314 Returning to differential equations Hamming studied means of numerically integrating them A popular approach at the time was Milnes Method attributed to Arthur Milne15 This had the drawback of being unstable so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise Hamming developed an improved version the Hamming predictorcorrector This was in use for many years but has since been superseded by the Adams method16 He did extensive research into digital filters devising a new filter the Hamming window and eventually writing an entire book on the subject Digital Filters 197717 During the 1950s he programmed one of the earliest computers the IBM 650 and with Ruth A Weiss developed the L2 programming language one of the earliest computer languages in 1956 It was widely used within the Bell Labs and also by external users who knew it as Bell 2 It was superseded by Fortran when the Bell Labs IBM 650 were replaced by the IBM 704 in 195718 In A Discipline of Programming 1976 Edsger Dijkstra attributed to Hamming the problem of efficiently finding regular numbers19 The problem became known as Hammings problem and the regular numbers are often referred to as Hamming numbers in Computer Science although he did not discover them20 Throughout his time at Bell Labs Hamming avoided management responsibilities He was promoted to management positions several times but always managed to make these only temporary I knew in a sense that by avoiding management he later recalled I was not doing my duty by the organization That is one of my biggest failures2 Later lifeedit Hamming served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery from 1958 to 19608 In 1960 he predicted that one day half of the Bell Labs budget would be spent on computing None of his colleagues thought that it would ever be so high but his forecast actually proved to be too low21 His philosophy on scientific computing appeared as the motto of his Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers 1962 The purpose of computing is insight not numbers22 In later life Hamming became interested in teaching Between 1960 and 1976 when he left Bell Labs he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University Stevens Institute of Technology the City College of New York the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University23 As a Young Turk Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs valued achievements he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed in the first half of his career at Bell Labs but none in the second He therefore resolved to retire in 1976 after thirty years2 In 1976 he moved to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey California where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science3 He gave up research and concentrated on teaching and writing books5 He noted that The way mathematics is currently taught it is exceedingly dull In the calculus book we are currently using on my campus I found no single problem whose answer I felt the student would care about The problems in the text have the dignity of solving a crossword puzzle  hard to be sure but the result is of no significance in life5 Hamming attempted to rectify the situation with a new text Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus Probability and Statistics 19855 In 1993 he remarked that when I left BTL I knew that that was the end of my scientific career When I retire from here in another sense its really the end2 And so it proved He became Professor Emeritus in June 199724 and delivered his last lecture in December 1997 just a few weeks before his death from a heart attack on January 7 19988 He was survived by his wife Wanda24 Hammings final recorded lecture series25 is maintained by Naval Postgraduate School along with ongoing work26 that preserves his insights and extends his
