\section{Introduction}

Instructions: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clone/copy this file and fill it with your content.
    \item Write no more than 8 pages (references do not count towards this).
    \item In ``Introduction'', briefly lay out the problem you address, and your contribution. Include an overview/teaser image.
    \item In ``Related Work'', reference both (1) a selection of previous works on the same/similar problems (and try to differentiate your approach from those), (2) a set of foundational literature relevant to the problem, and your methodology.
    \item ``Methodology'' lays out your technical approach, high-level, as well in technical detail. Subsections are highly recommended here (and also elsewhere).
    \item ``Evaluation'' should contain both a quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of your results. If in doubt about metrics and evaluation methodologies, talk to us.
    \item ``Discussion'' on the one hand builds upon the evaluation, and should critically discuss strengths and weaknesses of your solution, and possible ways to improve it further. On the other hand, it should discuss relevant ethical questions related to the problem and/or your solution at hand.
\end{enumerate}
