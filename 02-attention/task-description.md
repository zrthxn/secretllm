### Exercise 2
# Attention for Timeseries Prediction

This time we will learn how to implement attention and how it can improve prediction of timeseries data.

### 0. Setup the HPC
...
<!-- TODO: Write a preparation how-to doc -->

### 1. Download and read the dataset

Use the PANJAPAN timeseries values dataset from here: LINK
Read this using pandas and pre-process it to be ready for training.

### 2. Write a LSTM RNN and a training loop for the dataset

### 3. Plot results on test set

<!-- Home task until here -->
<!-- Rest will be shown only in the exercise -->

### 4. Implement attention

### 5. Train a simple model with attention and compare

- show attention on a timeseries and make analogous ref to words
- intuiitive explaination of Q, K, V
- relate the timeseries to word representations
