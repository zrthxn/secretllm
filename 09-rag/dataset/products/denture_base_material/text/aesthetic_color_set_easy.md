- What is it?: Aesthetic Color Set Easy is a color set offered by Candulor
- url: https://www.candulor.com/en/product-portfolio/denture-base-materials/aesthetic-color-set-easy
- Company's tag line: For Individualists
- Advantages
  1. LT Monomer â€“ longer processing times
  2. Can be adjusted to all possible color hues
  3. 3 pre-mixed color shades and 1 basic resin included
  4. Available as AESTHETIC RED and AESTHETIC BLUE

- Brief Description: The red fibres are incorporated into the denture base materials. This gives the gingiva a veined appearance and the dentures look natural. Intensive colors: 8 AESTHETIC Intensive Colors are available to sharpen the natural image in fabrication. You can create very special nuances with the color pigments. As special as your patient. Color opaque: The AESTHETIC Intensive Colors Opaque is an opaque, pink colored intensive shade, which can be added to the base resin specifically in partial as well as implant prosthetics to achieve higher opacity. This reduces metal parts shimmering through resins. Another indication is the covering of thin resin layers in the cervical regions of the teeth.

- When to use:
  1. Individual implant prosthetics
  2. Individual complete denture prosthetics
  3. Individual partial denture prosthetics
  4. Enhances existing prosthetic restorations

- Shades:
  1. Intensive pigmentation: Eight AESTHETIC Intensive Colors are available to replicate the natural appearance of the gingiva. By using the different AESTHETIC Intensive Colors, you can create patient-specific nuances. Stand in front of the mirror and look at the gingiva shade spectrum. This is characterized by different colored zones: with strong and poor blood circulation (attached gingiva), blue blood vessels, bright labial frenulum, and so on. It is also possible to address different ethnic groups.
  2. So simple. So individual. 3 different shade hues and the base material shade 34 of the AESTHETIC RED (hot polymer) and AESTHETIC BLUE (cold polymer) resins enable the gingiva to be individually shaded quickly and easily. The incident light is refracted by the semi-opaque pigmentation and reflected. This gives the pink of the artificial gingiva a particularly natural look. Shades: 34, 53, 55, 57


- Application:
  1. Soft: Staining of the marginal gingiva with shade 53. 
Base Original Pink 34.  
In the SOFT characterization, only the marginal gingiva is stained. This 1 - 2 mm narrow strip of tissue is the area which is immediately visible if the corners of the patient's mouth are slightly raised. The marginal gingiva runs garland-like along the contour of the tooth necks and has a smooth surface and a light pink coloration. We only use polymer color 53 for this purpose. It should be considered that there is a gradual transition between the marginal gingiva and the base material in color 34. For absolute individuality, individualization with AESTHETIC Intensive Colors is recommended in addition.

  2. Medium: Staining of the attached gingiva with shades 53 and 55.
Base Original Pink 34. MEDIUM characterization is an extension of the SOFT characterization in which the attached gingiva is also stained. This is indicated where the patient's high smile line is visible. This is a 3-9 mm wide strip of tissue, whose position is connected immovably and fixed with the periosteum of the alveolar ridge. This layer of soft tissue on the alveolar bone is relatively thin and is better perfused with blood. It is also worth noting that an irregularly distributed orange peel surface is identifiable from person to person. We use polymer color 55 to color the attached gingiva. For absolute individuality, individualization with AESTHETIC Intensive Colors is recommended in addition.

  3. Strong: Coloration with the stained resins 53, 55 and 57 for the alveolar mucosa, Base Original Pink 34.
With STRONG characterization, the alveolar mucosa is also characterized in addition to MEDIUM characterization. It is used with patients for whom a very large part of the front shield is identifiable. The mucogingival boundary between the attached gingiva and the alveolar mucosa is recognizable from a color change from light red to dark red mucosa. For us dental technicians the color distinction, which is attributable to the higher number of blood vessels, is important. We use color 57 for this coloration. We use the fibres for the finely branching arterial vessels. For absolute individuality, individualization with AESTHETIC Intensive Colors is recommended in addition.  

4. Individual: Individualization with the stained resins 53, 55, and 57 for the alveolar mucosa as well as characterization with the AESTHETIC Intensive Colors. Base Original Pink 34.
