- Brief description: This self-curing polymer is distinguished by its good flow properties. It is suitable for the pouring and flask pouring technique. AUTOPLAST was developed specifically for the matrix technique and flask pouring technique. This self-curing polymer is distinguished by its good flow properties. The flow phase was set at about 3 minutes. After a transient phase of 5 to 6 minutes, the material can be modeled for a further 3 minutes. This means that several saddles can be worked easily and correctly with the pouring method. The Polymaster, a pouring flask, is suitable for this pouring resin.
