- What is it?: Aesthetic Color Set Easy Mini is a color set offered by Candulor
- Company's tag line: Compact beginner's set with three pre-mixed color shades

- Brief Description: Creating dentures; Whether HOT or COLD, this compact beginner's set with three pre-mixed polymers, shade 53 whitish stain, shade 55 reddish stain, shade 57 brownish-violet stain, allows the dental technician to create individual pigmentation of the gingiva in an easy, but above all, fast manner. 

The characterizing resins of the AESTHETIC Color Set Easy Mini are available as hot polymer AESTHETIC RED and as cold polymer AESTHETIC BLUE.

AESTHETIC LT Modelling Monomer With the AESTHETIC LT (Long Time) Modelling Monomer you have the option of extending the processing time of AESTHETIC RED / AESTHETIC BLUE. This enables you to create a sufficiently long modelling phase. It is suitable for use with the AESTHETIC Intensive Colors.

- Advantages: 
  1. LT Monomer â€“ longer processing times
  2. Can be adjusted to numerous color hues
  3. 3 pre-mixed color shades included
  4. Available as AESTHETIC RED and AESTHETIC BLUE

- When to use:
  1. Individual implant prosthetics
  2. Individual complete denture prosthetics
  3. Individual partial denture prosthetics
  4. Enhances existing prosthetic restorations

- Application
  1. Soft: Staining of the marginal gingiva with shade 53. Base Original Pink 34. In the SOFT characterization, only the marginal gingiva is stained. This 1-2 mm narrow strip of tissue is the area which is immediately visible if the corners of the patient's mouth are slightly raised. The marginal gingiva runs garland-like along the contour of the tooth necks and has a smooth surface and a light pink coloration. We only use polymer color 53 for this purpose. It should be considered that there is a gradual transition between the marginal gingiva and the base material in color 34.
  2. Medium: Staining of the attached gingiva with shades 53 and 55. Base Original Pink 34. MEDIUM characterization is an extension of the SOFT characterization in which the attached gingiva is also stained. This is indicated where the patient's high smile line is visible. This is a 3-9 mm wide strip of tissue, whose position is connected immovably and fixed with the periosteum of the alveolar ridge. This layer of soft tissue on the alveolar bone is relatively thin and is better perfused with blood. It is also worth noting that an irregularly distributed orange peel surface is identifiable from person to person. We use polymer color 55 to color the attached gingiva
  3. Strong: Coloration with the stained resins 53, 55 and 57 for the alveolar mucosa, Base Original Pink 34. With STRONG characterization, the alveolar mucosa is also characterized in addition to MEDIUM characterization. It is used with patients for whom a very large part of the front shield is identifiable. The mucogingival boundary between the attached gingiva and the alveolar mucosa is recognizable from a color change from light red to dark red mucosa. For us dental technicians the color distinction, which is attributable to the higher number of blood vessels, is important. We use color 57 for this coloration.
