- Brief Description: The high-impact polymer is suitable for cold and hot polymerization. Due to its good flow properties, it is comfortable to work with and ensures an esthetic appearance with both low plaque adhesion and low tendency to discoloration. The high-impact polymer for dual use. Developed to cover the different processes and needs in the laboratory. The polymer is suitable for cold and hot polymerization. Whether packing, pressing or pouring: the choice of HOT or COLD processing is governed by the respective HOT or COLD monomer component.

- Tips, usage and FAQ:

Owing to the close and good cooperation with our partners and customers, a number of user tips and tricks have been collected for you. These are intended to support you in the processing of XPLEX but also as possible solutions for challenges in the processing of dental base materials.

- IMPORTANT: Please note that application as recommended in the instructions for use is particularly important to achieve the desired result.

1. How can XPLEX flow properly in the casting process?

Answer: The mixing ratio for the casting technique in cold processing can be adjusted marginally for better
flow properties, from existing 20 g polymer : 13 ml monomer to 22 g polymer : 16 ml monomer. This
is an additionally validated mixing ratio. The changed mixing ratio does not change the physical
properties!

2. How can the flow be improved in the interdental spaces?

Answer: After sandblasting wet the teeth with monomer. The type of wax modeling also has an impact on the
flow behavior.

3. How can bubbles in the resin be avoided?

Answer: The air bubbles are caused by rising air voids in the groove retentions of the basal tooth sections and
air from the interdental spaces. The grooves should be placed in line with the flow direction of the
resin. Wet the teeth with monomer. Slowly fill the counter cast through an opening. Shaking the
counter cast allows the air bubbles to rise. Only add the resin to the pressure pot once the plastic
phase has been reached.

4. How do I improve the fit of the ah line?

Answer: The fit at the ah line depends on the following factors:

a. The shrinkage behavior of the resin.
*Rule*: the less monomer, the less the gap at the dorsal margin.

b. The pressure with which the resin is placed in a mold until it cures. E.g. 2-5 bar for the casting
process; up to 90 bar for the injection process.

c. The type, surface and profile of the dorsal margin.

d. A high palate provokes a larger gap than a flat palate. Only add the resin to the pressure pot once
the plastic phase has been reached.


5. How to avoid whitish resin surface to the silicone?

Answer: Some K-silicones form condensation residues on the surface, which affect the surface of the resin
during the flow phase. This results in a whitish, thin layer on the surface. Occurs predominantly in the
casting process. The contacting liquid resin is very active chemically. Removing the condensation
layer with alcohol or monomer using cotton swabs before inserting the teeth into the silicone wall
works well.


6. How do I avoid drying of the resin and the whitish appearance during reworking?

Answer: The mixed XPLEX resin should be allowed to swell a little longer before being applied during repair
work so that the monomer can penetrate the polymer beads better. As a result, the resin does not "dry
out" as quickly at the margins of the areas to be repaired. Wet the repair areas with the monomer and
apply the resin in as solid a consistency as possible.
