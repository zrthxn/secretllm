- Available since: 1999
- Feature: Age-appropriate design 
- Material: TwinCrossedResin. TCR acrylic (TwinCrossedResin) is a highly modified type of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) variant in which both the polymer and the matrix are cross-linked. This is done by producing highly cross-linked polymer in combination with cross-linked matrix. This ensures good abrasion resistance and resistance to plaque* for these prosthetic teeth. Highly cross-linked PMMA network with cross-linking of the polymer chains.
