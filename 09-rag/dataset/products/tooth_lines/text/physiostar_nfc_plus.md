- Brief description: Our PhysioStar brand has accompanied our customers for more than 10 years. The composite denture tooth is the favorite in the CANDULOR portfolio when it comes to maximum esthetics and function. Let us convince you of the authenticity of this tooth line. The composite denture tooth is the “Star” in the CANDULOR portfolio when it comes to maximum esthetics and function. The NFC+ material impresses with its very good abrasion resistance, which is significantly higher than that of all the tooth materials previously used by Candulor.

The NFC+ material impresses with its very good abrasion resistance, which is significantly higher than that of the tooth materials previously used by Candulor. This counteracts premature tooth wear and the associated vertical dimensional loss. NFC+ is a composite based on a urethane dimethyl acrylate matrix (UDMA matrix) composed of various types and sizes of fillers as well as PMMA clusters. This results in very good physical material properties, such as abrasion resistance and shear strength. This makes these prosthetic teeth particularly suitable for implant work. 

Composite material with a homogeneous distribution of inorganic fillers and PMMA clusters: 
- Feature: Natural design
- Available since: 2012
- Designed by: Jan Langner
- Layering: With the layering, close attention has been paid to give a natural and esthetic appearance. The material is built-up in four layers, which guarantees color fastness in the mouth and gives a particularly natural appearance.
- Physiological setup: The Bonartic II NFC+ meets the esthetic-morphological demands. The occlusion morphology of the lower posterior teeth stands in relation to the condyle path. The inclination of the occlusional plane (Spee, Wilson) can be arranged individually and reliably with the Bonartic II NFC+. It is the most important stabilizing element for every prosthetic restoration. The teeth were optimized in terms of a natural tooth to two-tooth relationship.

### Details about anteriors:

Delicate (Group 55)
These tooth shapes are distinguished by their delicate and naturally tapered shapes. The gentle design of the contours and the youthful incisal edges differentiate this juvenile group.

Universal (Group 66)
The group with the greatest flexibility of use for all age groups. These tooth shapes offer versatile use with square centers and narrow posterior incisors.

Vigorous (Group 77)
The powerful characteristics of these vigorous shapes with their angular contours are impressive. The look of these tooth shapes is underlined by the authentic abrasions on the incisal edges.

Individual (Group 88)
Natural and asymmetric shapes distinguish this group of anteriors. The shapes can be used for all age groups and create an unmistakable character through offset placement.

Mandible (Group 99)
With advancing age, the mandibular anterior tooth shapes become more prominent. PhysioStar NFC+ mandibular shapes are unique in their natural morphology as well as from an esthetic point of view.

### Setup according to Prof. Dr. A. Gerber

Prof. Dr. A. Gerber established the functional relationship between the shapes of the temporomandibular joints and the occlusal surfaces and as a result, developed the Condyloform tooth on this basis. The modern Condyloform II NFC+ offers anatomically good occlusion design with age-adapted morphological and natural occlusal proportions and functional areas. The mortar and pestle principle according to Prof. Dr. A. Gerber is also integrated. It enables autonomous chewing stability of each individual posterior tooth, as the upper palatal cusp occludes in the central fossa of its main antagonist.
