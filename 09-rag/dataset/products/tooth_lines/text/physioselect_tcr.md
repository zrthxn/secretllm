TCR acrylic (TwinCrossedResin) is a highly modified type of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) variant in which both the polymer and the matrix are evenly cross-linked. This is done by again cross-linking the previously cross-linked polymer with the matrix in the production process. This ensures good abrasion resistance and resistance to plaque. Highly cross-linked PMMA network with increased cross-linking of the polymer chains

- Shades: A–D shades: 16, Bleach shades: 2
- Number of molds: 18 upper jaw molds. 4 lower jaw molds
- Number of layers: 4
- Matching posterior teeth: BONSELECT TCR, BONARTIC TCR
- Layering: PhysioSelect TCR is a composition of slightly translucent incisal contours with discreet mamelons and translucent marginal ridge eff ects paired with a lively 4-fold layering and incisal light refraction. A fine microstructure with horizontal growth grooves, plus a striking macrostructure with vertical ridges, grooves and fine openings gives the tooth a naturally youthful refraction.

The new posterior BonSelect TCR tooth was created to match the PhysioSelect TCR – a posterior tooth with an occlusion concept that can be used multifunctionally for the most common setup systems. Whether tooth to tooth or tooth to two-tooth, the BonSelect TCR has a bi-functional tooth geometry that makes both setup systems possible. Simplified centric determination through defined contact points leads to an easily adjustable occlusion. The BonSelect TCR is a good choice for laboratories that use different setup concepts. The layering is matched to the PhysioSelect TCR anterior tooth line. Harmony in design and function.
