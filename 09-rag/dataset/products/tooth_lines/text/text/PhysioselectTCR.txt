PhysioSelect TCR is a composition of slightly translucent incisal contours with discreet mamelons and translucent marginal ridge eff ects paired with a lively 4-fold layering and incisal light refraction.

A fine microstructure with horizontal growth grooves, plus a striking macrostructure with vertical ridges, grooves and fine openings gives the tooth a naturally youthful refraction. Its an all rounder.

The fresh, youthful design of the PHYSIOSELECT TCR was developed from the origin of proven tooth molds. The teeth, which are designed in Switzerland, are made of the reliable TwinCrossedResin material of the third generation.
