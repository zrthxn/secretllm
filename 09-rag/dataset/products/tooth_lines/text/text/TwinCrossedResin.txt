The highly networked TCR material impresses with its material and resistance properties.
TCR acrylic (TwinCrossedResin) is a highly modified type of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) variant in which both the polymer and the matrix are evenly cross-linked. This is done by again cross-linking the previously cross-linked polymer with the matrix in the production process. This ensures good abrasion resistance and resistance to plaque.
