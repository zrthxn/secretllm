PREFERENCE ACRYLIC
A true classic. The Preference tooth line is a combination of natural esthetics and user-friendliness. The prosthetic teeth have been selected for universal use in partial, full and combination dentures.

Preference posterior teeth
The posterior teeth are easy to position owing to their defined centricity. Due to the functionally designed occlusion surface, these can be used multi-functionally for the most common set-up philosophies.

Material
The proven acrylic material allows good bonding to prosthetic materials. The available PMMA polymers on the market have significant differences in purity, enclosed porosities and contamination. Consistent grain size and molecular weight are also deciding factors in the production of teeth with good and consistent quality.

Proven PMMA network with less pronounced cross-linking of the polymer chains:

Layering
The naturalness of the teeth is created by the three-layered, authentic shade design. The diversity in shapes enables that you can choose the appropriate tooth for your patient.
