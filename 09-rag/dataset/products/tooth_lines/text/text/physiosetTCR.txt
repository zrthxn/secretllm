PhysioSet TCR

Exceptional variety of type-specific tooth shapes and a special surface profile distinguish this tooth line.

The double cross-linked TCR material has good material and resistance properties.

Material
TCR acrylic (TwinCrossedResin) is a highly modified type of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) variant in which both the polymer and the matrix are cross-linked. This is done by producing highly cross-linked polymer in combination with cross-linked matrix. This ensures good abrasion resistance and resistance to plaque* for these prosthetic teeth.

Highly cross-linked PMMA network with cross-linking of the polymer chains:

Layering
The appearance of the pre-fabricated teeth is achieved by the multi-layer process, life-like layering and the natural surface profile. With its two shade systems and the combination with good material properties, the TCR tooth line is suitable for both full dentures as well as partial and combined dentures.


Bonartic TCR combines the physiological laws of nature and the esthetic-morphological demands into a good looking denture tooth.
