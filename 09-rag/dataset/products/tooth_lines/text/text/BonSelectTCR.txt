BonSelect TCR
The new posterior BonSelect TCR tooth was created to match the PhysioSelect TCR â€“ a posterior tooth with an occlusion concept that can be used multifunctionally for the most common setup systems.

Whether tooth to tooth or tooth to two-tooth, the BonSelect TCR has a bi-functional tooth geometry that makes both setup systems possible. Simplified centric determination through defined contact points leads to an easily adjustable occlusion. The BonSelect TCR is a good choice for laboratories that use different setup concepts. The layering is matched to the PhysioSelect TCR anterior tooth line. Harmony in design and function.
