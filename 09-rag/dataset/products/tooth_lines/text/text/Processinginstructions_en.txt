Processing instructions for CANDULOR denture teeth

It must be ensured that the stability of the teeth and the correct shade effect are maintained. It is therefore recommended to observe the minimum layer thickness.

Minimum layer thickness for PMMA/composite teeth:
> Anterior teeth: min. 2.5 mm
> Posterior teeth: Central fossa min. 2.0 mm, cusp tips min.
2.5 mm, cervical area min. 2.5 mm

To ensure that removable dentures remain functional over longer
periods of time, the following prerequisites should be met:

> Dental materials may only be processed by dental
professionals.
> Fabrication in the dental laboratory according to the
principles of best practice.
> To ensure a reliable material bond between PMMA/composite teeth and the denture base material, clean the teeth with
steam, roughen them and apply monomer. When using an
self-curing polymer for finishing, it is recommended to create
additional mechanical retentions.
> The teeth should not come into contact with a flame or direct
heat (for example alcohol torch).
> Heat development as a result of too much pressure during
grinding must be prevented.
> Contact with solvents must be prevented.
