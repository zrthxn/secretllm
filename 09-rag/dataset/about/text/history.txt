- The Steen & Zech Zahnfabrik was founded in Zurich, Switzerland, on November 1, 1936, by Alfred Wilhelm Steen and Wilhelm Karl Zech. This company quickly became one of the most renowned tooth manufacturers in Central Europe, with up to 300 employees during the post-war period. The success was largely due to the high-quality Swiss standards they maintained.

- In the 1950s, Wilhelm Karl Zech sold his shares of the company to Alfred Wilhelm Steen. To reflect this change, the company was renamed to Alfred Steen CANDULOR Dentalwerk. The name CANDULOR is derived from the Latin for shine 'candor' and French for gold 'or'.
